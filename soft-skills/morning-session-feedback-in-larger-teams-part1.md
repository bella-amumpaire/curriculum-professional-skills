# Morning session: Feedback in larger teams part 1

## Learning objectives

- Understand that getting good at giving and receiving constructive feedback takes practice with each new team you work with.
- Learn from feedback about areas to improve as a team member in key areas including reliability, commitment, communication, time management.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5hr

## Description

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

*Spend 5 minutes on this section individually*

In this morning session, you will continue practicing how to give and receive feedback. This is very important for the final capstone project where you'll be evaluated on your teamwork skills by the evaluator, including giving and receiving feedback.

### Why is feedback in larger teams important?

Because when working in teams, we are working with people who have different personalities, viewpoints, and ways of doing things. To efficiently work together in a team setting, we need to be able to give positive and constructive feedback to each other so that everyone can learn from the feedback, learn how to work better together, and thus improve the project's advancement.

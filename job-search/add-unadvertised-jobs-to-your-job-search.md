# Add unadvertised jobs to your job search

## Learning objectives

-  Identify 5 places you can search for remote jobs online.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

In this exercise, you will learn how to find unadvertised jobs. Thus, you will be able to broaden your search for job opportunities.

### Why is it important to add unadvertised jobs to your search?

During your first two months of job searching, you have used a limited number of online platforms to find jobs. You have experience using them and you have selected those that work best for you. An additional option is to look for unadvertised jobs, those that companies don’t post on online platforms. 

### What is the hidden job market, and how can I access it?

The term “hidden job market” describes job postings that are not published on online job searching platforms. Read this article to learn more about this market and how to find those unadvertised jobs.

# Peer-to-peer interview practice: Using body language during behavioral interviews

## Learning objectives

- Understanding how body language plays in during an interview.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise

During this morning session, you will learn about body language during interviews and pay attention to your nonverbal cues as you answer behavioral questions.

### Instructions

💡 **Remember that this meeting should take 1 hour, not 30 minutes.**

- Join the Zoom call with your team - remember to always be on time to respect your teammates’ time and practice respecting your interviewers’ time.
- Select a **leader** who will ensure you follow the outline below - do not skip any steps!


### Preparation - 15 min

1. In a big group, study the [body language cues that interviewers look at](https://recruitee.com/articles/reading-candidate-body-language-in-a-virtual-job-interview#3). Stop reading when you get to “Tips for conducting video job interviews”. 
    - Mute your microphones and read in silence.
    - Once you have finished, ensure everybody is familiar with the 7 cues.


### Interviewers setup - 5 min

1. Everybody will be an interviewer during the exercise, so each of you must follow the steps below:
    - Open [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pJ8BIhi39iYl6k498xqdAR_TfZhotunao2CTqF6L6Rs/edit#gid=2041017957) and get a list of randomly generated behavioral questions.
    - Read the list of questions and select two questions they will ask in the interview.
    - Reflect upon the attribute that the question helps interviewers identify in the interviewee, such as initiative, empathy, compassion, humility, and teamwork.
    - Open [this checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EwgT0KtbSXqigIlS_EbhzoLrWKrxZEsuGgyYsGcVEBA/edit) and copy the two questions you will be asking at the top of each section and register the attributes they will help interviewers identify. 
    - Read the criteria and indicators you will assess in the interview.

2. Split yourselves into groups of 2 and go into breakout rooms as you did [in this exercise](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/job-searching-morning-session-using-breakout-rooms-for-interview-practice.md#what-are-breakout-rooms).
    - **Set timer for breakout rooms - it should be 25 minutes.**
    - If there is an odd number of people in your group, one room will need to have 3 people.


### Quick interviews - 25 min

1. In your breakout rooms, you will take turns.
    - Each of you will play the role of an interviewer once and the role of an applicant once.

2. Take turns doing the interviews. In each one, the interviewer will ask 2 behavioral questions following these steps:
    - The interviewer opens the [following checklist for giving advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EwgT0KtbSXqigIlS_EbhzoLrWKrxZEsuGgyYsGcVEBA/edit). **You should fill it in during the interview if possible.**
    - The interviewer starts [timer](https://vclock.com/timer/#countdown=00:03:00&date=2022-06-24T17:11:04&sound=xylophone&loop=1).
    - The interviewer asks the first question.
    - **The applicant answers the question, paying special attention to their body language.**
    - The interviewer indicates when the time is up.
    - The interviewer shares with the applicant what the body language communicated (if possible, give concrete examples). (1 min)

**Do not extend the allocated time as it is important that you practice completing tasks on time, as you will need to in your actual interviews.**

3. When you finish all interviews:
     - All interviewers complete the checklist.
     - All interviewers share a filled-in checklist with the applicant. **The applicant will use this for their exercise submission**.


### Recap with the big group - 10 min

1. Come back to the main room in Zoom.
2. Use [this Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrclyLFtL6b5fMdT) form for a self-assessment and rating for the interviewer.
3. Share something you will work on based on one piece of feedback with the entire group.

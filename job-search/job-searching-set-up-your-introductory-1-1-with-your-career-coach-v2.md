# Job Searching - Set up your introductory 1:1 with your career coach

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Introduction

You should have received an email notification to schedule your introductory 1:1 session with your career coach by today, Thursday. Once you do so, take the time to prepare for this meeting. 

**If you haven't been assigned a career coach by Thursday midnight, please contact Student Success on Friday.** 

### Why is meeting up with your career coach important?

Meeting up with your career coach individually is a precious moment! 

It is when you get to talk about your job search and the challenges that come with it. You'll talk about your goals and you'll work together on a plan to achieve them.

### How to prepare for this 1:1 introductory session?

You don't need much preparation, but as a good practice, make sure to:

- Use the SMART method to set goals and prepare a draft of you job searching plan. Check how to apply this method to job searching [here](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/using-the-smart-method-to-create-your-job-search-plan.md). During your meeting, make sure you have your list close to you so you can share it with your coach easily.

- Be ready to take notes. This means have a pen and notebook ready for your session, or a clean new file open on your computer.

- Be prepared to talk about your goals and to work together on a plan to achieve them.

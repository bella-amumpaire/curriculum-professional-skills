# Contributing to open source projects

An **open source project** is a software project that is made available to the public to view, use, modify, and contribute to. Contributing to open source projects can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, share, and build experience, as well as build valuable connections with other developers (and even find potential employers).

## Signs of a good open source project

If you're just starting out, it helps to **know what to look for** in a good open source project. Among others, these are some essential attributes to watch out for:

- The project has an active repository with active maintainers
- The repository has clear instructions for how to setup a local environment
- There should be a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file that will tell you how to best contribute
- There should be a strong community behind it, with much communication between its members
- There should be "Good First Issue" type of labels that you could get started with.

If the project checks all of these boxes, you have a winner!

Remember that contributing to open source for the first time is **not easy, but it’s worth it**. Start small by setting up the development environment and by trying to fix something in the documentation. You can move to more complicated tasks once you are more familiar with the code.

## Open source etiquette

The rules of etiquette and expected behavior will vary across projects just as they will vary across companies. If the project has documentation explaining how people should contribute code (usually found in a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file), be sure to **read the documentation first it before opening a pull request**. The better you follow that project's formal and informal rules and norms of behavior, the more grateful the project maintainers will likely be to have you contributing.

Another way to make sure you fit in is to **spend some time reading the public discussions between the project maintainers and other contributors**. This will give you a sense of the culture. You might find that not every open source project is governed by particularly friendly, professional, or welcoming people. However, most open source projects are more welcoming to newcomers, so you should make sure to join projects that appear to have a more friendly community because these will be more worth your time. While it's important to respect the project's culture and practices, you deserve to be treated with respect too.

Last but not least, don’t forget that **contributing to open source is a networking opportunity**. For each company in your dream company spreadsheet, fill in the cell with the list of open source projects they maintain. Take a look at those projects and see if there are a few of them that you like and that you could help with. As you start making contributions, notice who the developers are reviewing and approving your pull requests, find them on Twitter, and add them to your “Software Development” list.

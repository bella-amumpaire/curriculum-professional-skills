# How do I analyze how my job search is going?

## **Step 1: Determine if there is really a problem**

It can take 2-4 weeks of applying to start hearing any responses (favorable or unfavorable). If you are in the first few weeks of your job search, you may need to just give it more time because the hiring process can be very lengthy.

**It could also be that you need to apply for more jobs.** How many jobs are you applying every day? You might need to increase your applications to increase your chances!

**Or you might need to customize your job applications for the specific position you are applying to.** Remember that your application materials have to highlight why you are a good candidate for that job and that company. Customizing applications takes time, but try to balance quantity and quality when you send applications.

The dashboard offers charts as seen [here](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Blse6pa5DAMLWODtVK8_9z6Urs2-eec3NRp8N2zoP6r2GwFgnJshn7q1jrTHxTykIDf-XlApgrVpgrDbNyORdYD7LbyAb430x-CyZLox_9zVqapsDdSGIRIcpdJ06RwZb50ohiAz).

**It’s also important to track visits to your portfolio page.**

This information can help determine where the process is stalled. GitHub offers some limited information when [viewing traffic to a repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/visualizing-repository-data-with-graphs/viewing-traffic-to-a-repository). If you didn't already, you can also install [Motomo](https://matomo.org/) or [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) if you are self-hosting.

If you have been applying to 3-5 jobs consistently every day for more than 4 weeks, and you are getting few responses, it might be time to move on to the next step.

Of course, you can always speak to one of the Microverse career coaches if you aren’t sure or if you just want some reassurance.

### **Step 2: Figure out what needs improvement**

**If you are getting portfolio visits but no responses, consider improving your portfolio:**

- Improve the UX and work on a more eye-catching design for your landing page and for the individual apps. If you didn't use one, [check out the templates we have designed specifically for Microverse students to use for their portfolios.](<https://www.figma.com/file/WuGzuv1ivRRqilLK8o7Ddz/Microverse-Student-Potfolio-Templates-(Copy)?node-id=2%3A9>) You could use one of these to reskin your portfolio to improve the UX.
- Get on Twitter and search these hashtags if you need inspiration: #100daychallenge, #dailyui
- Don't forget to improve your accessibility too! You can use this [Accessibility Cheatsheet](https://moritzgiessmann.de/accessibility-cheatsheet/) and this handy [A11Y Style Guide](https://a11y-style-guide.com/style-guide/).
- Refactor the code of your projects.
- Ask yourself if your code is as streamlined as it can be as you do this!
- Add new features to your projects. Example: if you have a store, add the option for users to create a wishlist or shopping list.
- Need more ideas? Review the [Public APIs list](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) to see if you can use any of these to improve your existing portfolio projects or to create a new project!
- Create and run unit tests if you haven't already. Many hiring managers or recruiters will immediately check to see if you have tests on your projects, so getting at least some unit tests working will show them that you care about testable, maintainable code.
- Get off of Heroku to reduce the time it takes to load your site.
- If you need a free host, check out [000Webhost](https://www.000webhost.com/).

You can also work on some additional projects to add to your portfolio:

- [Job Searching - How to plan a good side project](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/job-searching-how-to-plan-a-good-side-project.md)

**If you are not getting visits after a few weeks of consistent applications, consider improving your job search materials:**

- Run your resume through [Jobscan](https://www.jobscan.co/) and share the results with your career coach.
- NOTE: *Jobscan isn’t a perfect tool, but we can use the results together to see if there is anything we should change.*

**If you’re getting responses, but can’t get past the initial phone screen, it’s time to work on your interviewing skills. Here are links to helpful articles about interviews:**

**If you are getting take-home projects or technical interviews followed by rejections, determine what could be going wrong.**

Questions to consider:

- Is your code as efficient as it could be?
- If it was a live technical interview, did you speak your thoughts aloud through the process?
- Are your submissions failing on submission due to bugs, missing required packages, or third-party modules?
- If you needed help, did you go to the official documentation first or random Quora guy’s answer?
- Did all your code have unit tests?
- If this was a live, front-end coding exercise, did you remember to use your browser debugging tools?
- Did you write a proper README.md file (even if it wasn’t “required”)?

**Step 3: Do more networking**

**No matter why your job search is stalled, being active in the online developer community is beneficial in your job search.**

Here’s what you can do:

- Post in the [#networking](https://microverse-students.slack.com/archives/CQZBZ95V0) channel in Slack for daily prompts and to share networking ideas with other Microverse students.
- If you live in a city, check the [Meetup website](https://www.meetup.com/find/tech/) to see if there are tech events in your area that you can attend.
- Join [developer-focused Slack and Discord groups](https://hackernoon.com/developer-slack-channels-remote-job-freelance-project-98e9b70d6275) outside of Microverse.

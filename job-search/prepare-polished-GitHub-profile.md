# Prepare a polished version of your GitHub profile to start the revision process

## **Learning objectives**

- Prepare a strong GitHub profile.

### **Estimated time: 2h**

## **Description**

In this exercise, you will update your GitHub profile and submit it to your coach for review. Then, you and your coach will work together to refine it during the week.

## Refresher about the relevance of a GitHub profile 

Since GitHub hosts your code, it is the primary resource employers will refer to in order to find out who you are, what you've done, and what you're able to do. Therefore, creating a profile showcasing your skills and attributes might make the difference between being invited to interviews or not.

- Read the article [4 reasons to start or update your GitHub profile](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/magazine/4-reasons-to-start-or-update-your-github-profile) if you have any questions about why this profile is essential.


## Project setup

- Open up your GitHub profile.
- Open the latest version of your resume. 
- Open the [Assess your GitHub profile rubric and worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v6l9ApDNVc193nvFxcUJyPu5YdzyEjAEM8FYdr3FM2c/edit).

## **Exercise**

### **Instructions**

Your GitHub profile includes a short bio, a personal README, and the repositories for the different projects you have coded. In addition, you can manually pin some of the most complex projects you have worked on to highlight your unique skills. 
In this exercise, use the [Assess your GitHub profile rubric and worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v6l9ApDNVc193nvFxcUJyPu5YdzyEjAEM8FYdr3FM2c/edit) to make sure that you have completed these three components thoroughly and have updated your information.

1. Begin by looking at your Bio and your personal README.
- Read the requirements listed in section 1 of the worksheet.
- Look closely at your bio and personal README on GitHub and analyze whether or not you meet each requirement.
- Select the score that best applies and identify any improvements. Refer to the learning resources applicable.
- Make any necessary changes.

2. Continue by checking your pinned projects and your contributions chart. 
- Read the requirements listed in section 2 of the worksheet.
- Review your activity chart; verify that you have configured your dashboard to display pinned projects, and carefully analyze your pinned projects to identify whether or not they meet all the requirements.
- Select the score that best applies to each requirement and register possible improvements. 
- Make any necessary changes.

3. Finally, proceed to section 3. Check and correct the spelling and grammar of all the text in your profile. 

GitHub is not only a repository for your code but also a place where you interact with other software developers. Your projects' stars indicate that you are part of the software community. So reach out to other Micronauts or peers, asking them for stars!
 

### Submit your exercise

*Read [this FAQ](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234) for a reminder on how to submit your exercise.* 

Now go to your Student Dashboard and submit the **link to your GitHub Profile** so that your coach can review it and give you feedback. Remember that you must submit your material by Wednesday of the week it's due so that career coaches can review it on time.

NOTE: You don't need to submit the worksheet. It is intended to help you assess if your resume meets the requirements in the rubric.

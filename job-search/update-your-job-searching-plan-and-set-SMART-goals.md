# Update your job searching plan and set SMART goals

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Description

In this exercise, you will review and update your job searching plan considering two areas: sending job applications and interview preparation. You will work on the two other areas (networking and working on side projects) later on.

### Why is important to update your job searching plan?

You are now starting a challenging endeavor: getting that amazing job as a software developer. As you you have seen and experienced, breaking down a complex goal into small attainable ones gives us direction and helps us stay organized. We can track our achievements over time and re-direct our efforts if necessary. So, since you will now be job searching intensively, itâ€™s a good idea for you to take another look at the job search plan that you created during the core program and make any necessary adjustments.

As context for your plan, it's important to think of your long- and midterm professional goals, because the job you are looking for is a step in that direction. These goals are aspirational. They describe what you wish to achieve in your career, your dreams. Right now, it doesn't matter if you have a vague idea. Start by writing it out and you will be able to refine it later as you get more information about the software developer job market and as you deepen your introspection.

### Refresher on setting job searching SMART goals

The Microverse curriculum shows you the four core areas where you have to work:

- sending job applications
- preparing for interviews (or participate in them)
- strengthening your technical skills and working on side projects
- networking

Yet there is room for you to decide how much time and effort you invest in each activity daily, and you can prioritize some tasks that align better to your specific situation and needs.

The SMART method is useful to plan how we will approach job searching and you have already practiced using it. If you need to refresh your memory, check the following resource:

- [Using the SMART method to create your job search plan](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/using-the-smart-method-to-create-your-job-search-plan.md).

### A reminder of your previously created job searching plan

As input for your current job plan, remind yourself of the job search plan and the SMART goals that you created in the core program. We include here links to the exercises where you worked on them:

- [Define and set SMART goals for networking](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/define-and-set-smart-goals-for-your-networking-efforts.md)
- [Use feedback to set some interview-related SMART goals](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/mock-interviews/use-feedback-to-set-some-interview-related-smart-goals.md)

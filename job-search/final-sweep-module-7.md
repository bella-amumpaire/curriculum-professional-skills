# Final Sweep: prep all your application materials for your coach to review

## Learning objectives:

- Review all your job application materials and highlight anything that is out of date.

### **Estimated time**: 3 hrs

## What is the final sweep?

You're now job searching and tomorrow your will start sending job applications daily! So, it's time to make sure that everything you need to successfully apply to jobs is looking great. This exercise will help you take a quick look at all the application materials you've created through your time in Microverse, make sure they're looking great, and then submit them to your career coach for review.

### Why is the final sweep important?

Job searching can be a long process. In order to reduce the time it takes for you to land your next role at a company you love, you want to make sure your application materials look excellent and stand out from the crowd. You've gotten reviews from project reviewers on this work so far. Now, Micorverse career coaches will come through and will help you polish them.

Refining your application materials is a complex endeavor that you will achieve throughout modules 7 and 8. It will require a lot of time and dedication because you need to find the best way to showcase your skills and your experience. You will need to go through many rounds of revision with career coaches and integrate carefully the changes they suggest.

The final sweep is a first round where you update and check the format, functionality, and information of all your application materials, so that you get off to a good start when submitting job applications. Later on, you will work with career coaches to refine their content of each one of them during a whole week. So, when you finish module 8, you will have polished all of your materials, and thus you will increase your chances of being invited for interviews when you apply for jobs.

### Review each of your projects

In order to make the best use of time and avoid unnecesary revisions, make sure you look carefully through each of your professional skills projects before you submit the final sweep. Here are links to the initial project walkthroughs, so you can remind yourself what to look for.

Now go to your Student Dashboard and **submit your Google Doc with the links to all your application materials**. Once you are assigned a career coach, they will give you feedback on your job searching materials, so you can make updates.

Please make your submission no later than on Wednesday of the week it's due, so that coaches will have time to review it before the end of the block.

You will submit the Final Sweep only once, because next week you will start polishing each one of them in depth during a whole week. It's important that you implement any changes suggested by your coach as soon as possible, since eliminating any error or non-working link can increase your chances of being invited to interviews.

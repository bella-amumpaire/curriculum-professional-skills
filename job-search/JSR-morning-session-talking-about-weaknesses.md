### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

During this morning session, you will practice with one of your peers how to talk about your weaknesses in a job interview.

### Instructions

ðŸ’¡ T**his meeting should take 1 hour, not 30 minutes.**

- Join the Zoom call with your team - remember to be on time to respect your teammatesâ€™ time.
- Select a **master of the session** who will ensure you follow the outline below - do not skip any steps!

### Preparation - 10 min

1. In a big group, each will read the article [â€œInterview question: What is your greatest weakness?"](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-your-greatest-weakness-2061288)
    - Mute your microphones and read in silence.

### Interview preparation - 10 min

1. Everybody will be an applicant during the exercise, so each of you must follow the steps below:
    - Identify 2 weaknesses that you can talk about in an interview and write them in [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xLk5D3zgcJE_m8xkM_I5kcOqEVvm2YbS-BCBarXCj3I/edit?usp=sharing).
    - Complete steps 2 and 3 to prepare your answer.
    - Open the [following checklist for providing feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jX3EldUoZQCZbVinBHAACXXPAS6IK2hCzV5apE065o4/edit?usp=sharing) and read the criteria and indicators that will be used to assess your performance. Make any necessary edits to ensure your answer satisfies all requirements.
2. Split yourselves into groups of 2 and go into breakout rooms as you did [in this exercise](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/job-searching-morning-session-using-breakout-rooms-for-interview-practice.md#what-are-breakout-rooms).
    - **Set timer for breakout rooms - it should be 10 minutes.**
    - If there is an odd number of people in your group, one room will have 3 people.

### Quick interviews - 20 min

1. In your breakout rooms, you will take turns. 
    - Each of you will play the role of an interviewer once and the role of an applicant once.
2. Take turns interviewing each other. 
    - The interviewer:
        - opens the [following checklist for giving advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jX3EldUoZQCZbVinBHAACXXPAS6IK2hCzV5apE065o4/edit?usp=sharing),
        - starts [timer](https://vclock.com/timer/#countdown=00:03:00&date=2022-06-24T17:11:04&sound=xylophone&loop=1), and
        - asks the question: What is your greatest weakness? a first time.
    - **The applicant answers following the tips offered in the article.**
    - The interviewer:
        - listens and assesses the applicant's answers - if possible, fills the third and fourth columns of the checklist during the interview),
        - indicates when the time is up and completes the checklist;
        - shares feedback on the applicantâ€™s preformance (2 min).
    
    **Do not extend the allocated time as it is important that you practice completing tasks on time, as you will need to in your actual interviews.**
    
    - The interview asks the question **What is your greatest weakness?** a second time and both, the interviewer and applicant, follow again the steps above.
    - You change roles and now the applicant plays the interviewer role.
3. When you finish all interviews:
    - All interviewers share a filled-in checklist with the applicant. **The applicant will use this for their exercise submission**.

### Recap with the big group - 15 min

1. Come back to the main room in Zoom.
2. Share something you will work on based on one piece of feedback with the entire group.
3. Use [this Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrclyLFtL6b5fMdT) form for a self-assessment and rating for the interviewer.

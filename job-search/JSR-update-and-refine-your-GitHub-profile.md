# Update and refine your GitHub profile

## **Learning objectives**

- Prepare a strong GitHub profile.

### **Estimated time: 2h**

## **Description**

Now, it’s time to focus on your GitHub profile and submit it to your coach for review. For software developers, this profile is particularly relevant. 

Remember that your GitHub profile **must be approved** to complete the block successfully and you have:

- **Two rounds of reviews**, so study the coach’s comments carefully and integrate any changes required
- **Two weeks** to get your profile approved. We recommend you submit your first version as soon as possible to have time to go through the necessary rounds of revision. Coaches might take up to 4 days to send you their feedback.

## Why is a GitHub profile important?

Your GitHub profile will be used during the recruitment process, recruiters will use GitHub to:

1. Assess **your coding skills**. Since GitHub hosts repositories with your code, it is the primary resource employers will refer to find out what you can do.
2. Find out **who you are**. Your profile includes a short bio and a personal README that will let recruiters and other stakeholders learn more about you.
3. Check on **your coding activity**. GitHub also provides evidence of  how frequently you code. So keeping it green shows you are committed to coding.
4. Learn about **your participation in the software community**. GitHub is not only a repository for your code but also a place where you interact with other software developers. Your projects' stars are indicators of your interaction with other coders.

Read the article [4 reasons to start or update your GitHub profile](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/magazine/4-reasons-to-start-or-update-your-github-profile) if you have any questions about why this profile is essential.

## Attributes and an example of a good GitHub profile 

A compelling profile provides information for the purposes above in your short bio, personal README, and the repositories for the different projects you have coded. The [GitHub rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bKRDHlZMUc9xIQrktnoRMs8Z6e3k_fdeFipr1IT1cWw/edit#) that you will use in this activity, provides a detailed list of attributes. Yet, nothing like a realy example to show !, but now, take a look at and excellent example. It belongs to a Micronaut whose profile helped him get an amazing job.

## Learning objectives

- Describe the steps in the job application process.

### **Estimated time**: 0.25h

## Description

In this lesson we will introduce the job application process you will study and perform during the rest of the module. 

### Why is it important to learn how to submit a job application?

Job applications are the first phase in the recruitment process of the company. Since there will be many candidates it’s critical to ensure that your job application stands out because it will increase your chances of being invited to interviews. So learning how to prepare compelling job applications will set you off to a good start. 

### What are the steps that I will learn?

Submitting a job application comprises five steps:

1. Finding a job to apply to.
2. Researching the company.
3. Creating your cover letter.
4. Customizing your resume.
5. Sending your job application.

Each step includes several activities that may take between 45 min and 2 hours. Throughout this block and the next one, you will find an exercise where we show you how to complete each step and share with you some resources and tools you can use in the future. 

You should select at least one job application to go through the whole process, but as you go through the process, you can decide to apply to several jobs.

### Will I need to submit the job application for review?

In this case, you will only submit the cover letter you create in step 3 for review by a coach since you have already submitted your other application materials.

### Will I need to perform all these steps when I submit job applications?

No. As you will experience, going through these steps thoroughly can be a painstaking process that may become repetitive and boring because you need to send many applications to get a job. So once you have learned the steps, it makes sense to be strategic and invest your efforts selectively. You may omit some of the tasks in each step or do them superficially.

When sending job applications there will always be a tradeoff between quality and quantity. Customizing your resume and cover letter carefully and researching the position and the company will take a lot of time. Yet this will increase your chances of standing out and being invited to an interview. At the same time sending many applications - maybe not so carefully crafted - will also increase the probability of finding that job opportunity that is right for you. So it’s crucial to combine a personalized approach while simultaneously using brute force and sending many applications without much customization. The challenge for you is deciding where to target your time and efforts.

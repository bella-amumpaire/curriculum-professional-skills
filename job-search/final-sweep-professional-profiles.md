# Final Sweep: revise your professional profiles

## **Learning objectives**

- Create a clear, compelling LinkedIn page.
- Create a clear, compelling Wellfound profile.

### **Estimated time: 1.5h**

## **Description**

Now, you will revise and edit the professional profiles that you created on Linkedin and Wellfound, before your coach reviews them.

## Why is it necessary to make one last round of revisions to your professional profiles?

After you have edited and updated your resume, it’s important to look at your professional profiles on online platforms. Most of the information that appears in the former is included in the latter also. Thus, you may need to integrate many of the changes and updates that you made to your resume into these profiles too. Additionally, you can correct errors and broken links that you or your reviewers have missed or introduced in the previous editing.

## Project setup

- Open up the revised version of your resume in Google Docs as a reference.

To review the LinkedIn profile:

- Open all written and numerical resume feedback from your project reviewer(s). You can find written feedback on your dashboard for each project under the **Action-->View Reviews** button.
- Open the [Linkedin profile rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MHmt3Vx4SRHa7z8PuoUiYg9eLakpi1qGPT6868bacGc/edit).
- Open the [create the first draft of a professional Linkedin page](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/create-first-draft-of-a-professional-linkedin-page.md) walkthrough.

To review the Wellfound profile:

- Open all written and numerical resume feedback from your project reviewer(s). You can find written feedback on your dashboard for each project under the **Action-->View Reviews** button.
- Open the [Wellfound profile rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lxBFRdvPW_cLQpX8n_gj8O8t1XPcXjGTDOCI813Uga0/edit).
- Open the [create the first draft of your Wellfound profile](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/create-the-first-draft-of-your-angellist-profile.md) walkthrough.

## Do a final sweep of your LinkedIn and Wellfound profiles

Follow these steps to revise your professional profiles on these two online platforms;

1. Read through all the sections of your profile on each platform; identify phrases that seem confusing and rewrite them if necessary.
2. Look at the changes that you made to your resume in the final sweep. Do any of them apply also to this profile? If so, integrate them in the appropriate section.
3. Check that all links you have included function properly.
4. Look at the feedback that you received from your reviewers and verify that you made all the corrections they requested.
5. Using the rubric, verify that each section meets the requirements. Refer to the [Create the first draft of a professional LinkedIn page](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/create-first-draft-of-a-professional-linkedin-page.md) or the [Create the first draft of your Wellfound profile](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/create-the-first-draft-of-your-angellist-profile.md) walkthroughs if you have questions about a particular section in the profiles. Update or add any information that is missing.
6. Finally, check the spelling and grammar one more time. Copy the text to a Google Doc and run it through Grammarly.

## Submission instructions

- You don’t need to submit the link to your revised Linkedin and Wellfound profiles now. You will make one submission of the final sweep of all your application materials.
- When you finish reviewing your GitHub profile, go to the Student Dashboard and mark this activity as completed.

# Sharing expectations and setting rules for interview practice this week  

## Learning objectives

- Recognize the importance of investing in good working relationships with teammates.

### **Estimated time**: 1hr

## Introduction

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group.* 

*Spend 10 minutes on this section individually*

Today you're going to share with your teammates your expectations about morning sessions and you will set working agreements on how you will support one another this week.

### Why is it important to set agreements with your team about morning sessions?

Job searching will be an intense and challenging activity for each one of you. Sometimes you may start feeling lonely and uneasy, especially if you don’t get invited to interviews and you don’t receive any feedback from recruiters. Other moments, if you get several interview invitations or take-home exams in the same week, you can feel overwhelmed, stressed, and maybe uncertain about how to handle the situation.

During morning sessions, you will meet with your group as you start your day. The support you can get from your peers will be important for you to get through difficult moments. Since each of you will be facing different challenges at any given moment, providing and receiving support might be complicated. 

This week, you and your teammates will continue practicing how to deal with common interview issues. To benefit from this practice, it's important that you first discuss the support you expect to get from your teammates and set some basic agreements on how you will help one another.

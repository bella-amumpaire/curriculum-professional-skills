### **Estimated time**: 0.5h


## Description

You are preparing for job interviews every day - by practicing interview questions, coding challenges, and take-home assignments. All those practices are making you ready for any job interview. However, what do you need to do when you have a job interview scheduled soon?

Please check the list below to be aware of the steps that you cannot skip and come back here any time you get a job interview. You can treat it as your "before-interview-checklist".


## A Step by Step Guide to Preparing for an Interview

### Check the stages of the recruitment process
The content of your interview will probably vary depending on whether you’re conducting an initial phone screen or a pair-programming technical interview. [Read over the different steps of the interview process](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051541194-What-are-the-different-steps-in-an-interview-process-) and assess exactly which type of interview you’re attending.

### Research company details
You need to know the details of the company you are applying for because of two reasons. First, you would like to understand whether this company is aligned with your goals. Secondly, you will show yourself as a professional who is really interested in the company itself. Read [How to Conduct Company Research For an Interview](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12005574199315-How-to-Conduct-Company-Research-For-an-Interview).

### Double-check your online meetings setup or interview location
Make sure that you will be able to appear for the interview on time without unnecessary stress. Read [How to Get to the Interview Interview Location (online or in-person)](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12005633905043-How-to-Get-to-the-Interview-Interview-Location-online-or-in-person-).

### Prepare for job offer-specific questions
You might have practiced a million interview questions but what you need the most are the questions that have the biggest probability to appear during the interview for the job offer you are currently applying for. There are ways to predict which questions you will get. Read [How to Prepare for the Questions that Most Likely Will Appear During Your Job Interview](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12005592550675-How-to-Prepare-for-the-Questions-that-Most-Likely-Will-Appear-During-Your-Job-Interview).

###  Prepare questions to ask your interviewer
Asking questions shows the interviewer that you’re genuinely interested in the position, and that you want to learn more about the logistics. Make a short list of 3-4 questions to ask the interviewer--just make sure not to ask questions you can easily find the answers to online, like “when was your company founded.” That will just make it seem like you haven’t done the research.
If you’re struggling with coming up with questions, check out [this list by Alison Green](https://www.thecut.com/article/questions-to-ask-in-a-job-interview.html) for a few examples.

### Check common mistakes
Make sure that you know what mistakes to avoid in an interview! This [list by Rebecca Koenig](https://money.usnews.com/money/careers/interviewing/articles/job-interview-mistakes-to-avoid) is an excellent resource, so read it over and make sure that none of the examples apply to you!
For extra credit, check out [this second article by Alison Green](https://www.thecut.com/article/explain-reasons-for-leaving-a-job.html)-- it talks about how to give a strong response if your interviewer asks why you left or were let go from previous jobs.

### Relax 
You did everything you could. Now it is time to relax! Good luck!

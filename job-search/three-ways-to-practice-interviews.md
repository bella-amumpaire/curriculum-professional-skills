# Four ways to practice interviews

Here are three ways you can practice interviews, in order of preference. 

1. **You have an interview with a company**

Well done! This is what you are aiming for. If a company has contacted you and you have a time and date set up for this week, great. You will submit an interview form for that. 

If you're still waiting to hear back from some applications, do not hesitate to ask for feedback. This could accelerate the process to get you an interview.  

 

2. **Organize a peer mock interview with your partner** 

If you do not have any interview set up with a company this week, you should organize a peer mock interview with your partner. Even if you think you *might* get an interview with a company, unless one is scheduled, go for a peer mock interview. The more practice you get, the better.

3. **Have a PRAMP mock interview**

If you do not have an interview set up with a company this week and that meeting with your partner for a peer mock interview is not possible either, then you should have a Pramp mock interview.

4. **Participate in morning sessions**

In the job searching modules, morning sessions will be dedicated to practicing different aspects of technical and behavioral interviews with your peers. We will provide you guidelines for structured practice and rubrics or checklists for feedback. Take advantage of these meetings to hone your interview skills!

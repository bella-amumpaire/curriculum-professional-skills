## Description

As you start the job searching process it is crucial to understand how the recruitment process works, who you will interact with at different stages, and identify what you can do to increase your chances of moving forward.

### Why is it important?

Job searching can be very challenging. Since many candidates apply for each position,  companies must find the one that is fit for the job efficiently. So they filter applicants with strategies designed to optimize the process. Familiarizing yourself with the recruitment process from the company's perspective helps you identify those screening moments and the factors you can control. Thus, you can focus on activities that will help you advance in recruitment and get a fantastic job.

**Key takeaways from the video:**

There are several steps to the recruitment process and it may vary from company to company. Generally the process is as follows:

1. Application (resume/CV, cover letter, and often some basic questions to answer upfront)
2. Recruiter screening
3. Hiring manager interview
4. Take-home assessment
5. Final interview
6. Offer and negotiation

### What can you do to stand out?

Since the recruitment process works like a funnel with specific screening moments, applicants are filtered based on their:

- Application materials
- Phone interview
- Test performance (online or take-home)
- Live interviews

Here are some ways you can stand out as a job seeker:

- Tailor your application materials to the job posting.
- Match keywords from the job description in your resume/CV and cover letter.
- Make sure your LinkedIn is updated and complete with your full work history.
- Research the company to draw up fantastic questions to ask each person in the interview process.
- Focus on professionalism and communication always. Your technical skills will show themselves, but you have to actively work to show your professionalism.

### Who will you talk to in the interview process?

Companies organize the interview process in different ways, but all of them include several steps where you talk with different members of the organization. If you know or can identify who you will be talking to and what information they are looking for, you can prepare yourself better for the interviews and increase your chances of moving through the process. 

Remember that each step is used to filter out candidates! (Click the image to open the video.)

Each person you speak to in the interview process will have a different angle and different interests:

1. Recruiter: looking for baseline technical skills, professionalism, and communication.
2. Hiring manager: looking for deep technical skills, team dynamics, and how it would be to work with you on a daily basis.
3. Team and/or important stakeholders: looking at how you collaborate, communicate, and how it would be to work with you on a daily basis.
4. Organizational leader: looking at how you will add to the future of the organization and what your growth/development opportunity is.

Throughout the whole process you should also identify what you want to learn from each person you speak to as well. Tailor your questions to that person so you can get the most out of the interview process.

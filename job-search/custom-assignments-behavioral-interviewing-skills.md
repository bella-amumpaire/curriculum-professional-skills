## Introduction

This personalized plan will guide you through the tasks you can work on this month to strengthen your behavioral interviewing skills. It is the specific job searching area your career coach recommends you to focus on considering your personal needs and achievements.

### Why is practicing your behavioral interviewing skills important?

Behavioral questions are designed to give the interviewer a better idea of how you work with others and how you learn from difficult experiences. Nearly every company relies on some common types of behavioral questions formats, so preparing in advance for those common types of questions will give you a much better chance of acing that interview and landing the job. 

Microverse career coaches have prepared this plan to help you continue to build strong behavioral interviewing skills and put them into practice immediately.

# Create stories for your behavioral grid with  CARL

## Learning objectives

- Answer common behavioral questions in the CARL format.

### **Estimated time**: .45h

## Description

In this exercise, you will create two new stories for your behavioral grid using the CARL format to ensure you describe the lessons learned in each experience. You will submit them to career coaches for review and approval. Your coach will send you feedback and request changes if necessary.

Your behavioral grid **must be approved** to complete the block successfully:

- This is a carry-over activity so you will have **two weeks to complete it**. We recommend you submit your first version as soon as possible to have time to go through the necessary rounds of revision. Coaches might take up to 4 days to send you their feedback.
- You have a maximum of **two rounds of reviews**, so study the coach’s comments carefully and integrate any changes required.

### Why do you need to add stories to your behavioral grid?

Very soon you will be looking for a job and answering behavioral interview questions that assess your soft skills and cultural fitness by analyzing your past experiences. Since you will be applying to companies with different missions, values, and cultures it’s handy to have multiple examples to draw from for each behavioral question you might be asked. Stories have a theme and you need to have at hand stories that convey different messages. You can thus select the one that best fits the specific role and company you are applying for.

### Instructions

*Check out this FAQ if you need a refresher on [Google Doc submission best practices](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063156813).*


1. Open [this behavioral grid template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1abnpb4XQY2VXdB37C3ViIl1V8-2Hjgtx6biPpkkzM_U/edit?usp=sharing). Make your copy by clicking *"File >> Make a Copy"*, and save it to your own Google Drive.
2. Follow the instructions in the template and write two stories using the CARL framework. 
3. Check the spelling and grammar using Grammarly.
4. Verify that all technologies and proper nouns are correctly capitalized (for example, use "JavaScript" instead of "Javascript", or "Ruby on Rails" instead of "ruby on rails").
5. Self-assess that your two stories meet all the requirements in [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H7RcFR0LXGK6OuKuEt7oo7TLAAMnDZauVDUvDIb-_f8/edit#). Make any necessary changes.
6. Configure the sharing options of your GDoc so that **anyone with the link** can leave suggestions. Your reviewer will then be able to make comments directly on the document.

# Tips for filling out your Experience section

- One option is to include your **highlighted personal projects** and then mention your app, the project description, why it’s useful or fun for the users, and list the tech stack it was built with. Then you can add a line saying: “For more info, see the project section below” (And you would add a link to that app in the projects section). In the “company” name, you can write “Self-employed.” See an example in [Manel Hammouche’s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manel-hammouche/) second entry in the Experience section or [Uduak Essein's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acushlakoncept/) experience entry as freelance software developer.

- Another strategy is to list **side- or freelance projects** you’ve worked, with clear technical and use-case details. [Zain Sadaquat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zain-sadaqat/) used this strategy to help him land a job: check the Fiverr entry in the experience section of his LinkedIn profile.
And a sidenote: a good way to gain experience for you is to join a startup even if it is for free and work a maximum of 3-4 hours everyday building a product that could be live within a maximum of 3 months. You will get a competitive advantage because you will be able to talk about real-life projects and scenarios in your cover letter and during interviews.

- Also, you can create entries that describe any coding activity you’ve participated in, such as:
    - Completed multiple group projects during coursework, demonstrating skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and project management.
    - Participated in a hackathon, developing a mobile app that won second place.
    - Completed a coding bootcamp, gaining skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    - Contributed to open-source projects on GitHub, gaining experience in collaborative software development.
    - Volunteered at a local nonprofit, helping to maintain their website and social media presence (unpaid).
    Remember that the entries have to reflect what you’ve done! Don’t simply make them up.

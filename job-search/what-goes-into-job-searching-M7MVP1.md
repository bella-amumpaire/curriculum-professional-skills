# What goes into job searching?

We have broken down the areas of your job search you do have control over into four categories:

**1. Active job applications/interviews**

This is what you may think of as "job searching" — sourcing jobs, applying to them, and interviewing! It’s an important part of the search and one you should do daily or every other day. In the first weeks you should apply to at least 5-10 jobs each week. Once you have mastered the five steps in the job application process you can increase the number of daily applications. But remember, when sending applications, it's not only a matter of quantity but also of quality.

**2. Interview preparation**

You may not have an interview for a few weeks, so you want to make sure you keep your interview skills fresh by practicing them. You also want to take everything you learn after each interview and put it into practice as soon as possible afterward so you can improve. (Were you asked a technical question you couldn't answer? A behavioral question that you felt unsure responding to? These are both opportunities to practice.) You will use peer-to-peer practice and PRAMP interviews to stay sharp for interviews until you accept an offer.

**3. Skills strengthening and working on side projects**

While looking for a job you will also want to make the most of this time and use it to learn new things (and keep that GitHub green)! You will be tasked with working on a new side project each month so that you can practice new skills, build new projects, keep your portfolio up to date, and keep your skills fresh. You can also look for workshops and activities to learn new things. These are often great networking opportunities as well.

**4. Networking**

Lastly you must make time to focus on networking and this week you will learn more about how to network. This activity may look different for each of you, but at the end of the day it ensures that you are becoming a part of the community around the career you want to join: remote web development. By doing this you will pave the way to a better job right now *and* in the future. We recommend ways to reach out using Twitter or LinkedIn, joining Slack communities, and participating in activities with other developers like Hackathons or open source projects.

### How will you know how much time to dedicate to each area of job searching?

In your Student Dashboard you will see activities dedicated to submitting applications, building your networks, and working on side projects. These are the essential tasks to get you a fantastic job. Try to develop the habit of working at all of them during the week. 

Depending on the results you are getting and your specific needs and interests, you will need to prioritize one job searching activity over the other. Your coach will help you identify which areas you need to work on to prioritize as you search for a job. They might also assign you some personalized assignments.

Also in the fourth week of each module you will analyze your job search so that you can establish SMART goals for the following one.

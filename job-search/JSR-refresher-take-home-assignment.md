# Refresher: take-home assignments

## Learning objectives

- Understand what to expect from a take-home project during an interview.

### **Estimated time**: 0.25h

## Description

A **take-home assignment** (also known as a take-home test, project, or exam) is an assessment method used to measure your technical ability. In this lesson you'll get a quick refresher on:

- Why take-home assignments exist
- What to expect from them
- How to get started when receiving one
- What to do after completion

## Why take-home assignments exist

A take-home assignment is an **alternative to live coding challenges** as an assessment method for measuring technical ability.

It often comes in the shape of a **list of requirements** (or user stories) that need to be converted into features either from scratch or based on a provided codebase.

When reviewing, a technical hiring manager or software developer will then try to ask themselves some of the following questions about the **code quality and architectural decisions** of your finished assignment:

- Is the code clean and readable?
- Does the project fulfill all its functional requirements?
- Have you written good documentation to explain your decisions?

As you can imagine, this can give much more insight into how you would perform on the job than a 30 minute coding challenge ever could!

## What to expect from them

Here's something you may not know: if you've worked on a Microverse capstone project, **you already have experience** with the format of a take-home assignment!

Microverse's capstone projects are designed not only to give you experience with creating beautiful full-stack projects but also to mimic the structure commonly seen in take-home assignments.

A take-home assignment from a company however has been more deliberately designed to **simulate the working conditions within that particular company**, by providing you:

- A "real" business case relevant to the company's domain
- Their specific tech stack to use _(but not always!)_
- A starter codebase to build on top of _(but not always!)_
- A list of requirements (or user stories) that need to be fulfilled
- A deadline by which the assignment should be completed (typically 24-72 hours after you've received it)

You are then asked to build it in whatever way you think is best!

## How to get started when receiving one

So you just received a take-home assignment. How exciting! Now let's get down to business.

### 1. Get a good understanding of the requirements

Your technical skills are useless if youâ€™re not solving the correct problem. That's why it's crucial to start by getting a good understanding of the requirements (functional and non-functional).

### 2. Follow up with the hiring manager

No matter what, **always reply back to the hiring manager** that you've successfully received the assignment.

This is also an opportunity to **ask any clarifying questions** regarding the requirements. Keep in mind that you don't have perfect information and it's better to overcommunicate your thoughts and concerns than just blindly start implementing whatever you think is best!

### 3. Make a plan in pseudocode

Once you've got all the necessary information to begin the assignment, **take some time to think out your solution**.

The best way to do so is to **make a plan in pseudocode**. You can do this in your `index`, `main`, or `README` file, so it's the first thing the reviewer will see.

Inevitably you will have to make **assumptions** as well as think about **edge cases**. Put these in your plan as well! This will show the interviewer what constraints you've chosen to work within.

### 4. Decide what to build yourself vs. using a library

You don't have to build everything from scratch. However when to build something yourself as opposed to using an open source dependency library depends on a few factors:

- What is allowed by the assignment?
- How much time are you willing to spend on building something from scratch?
- If choosing a library, can you give a good argument why you chose that one in your project?

### 5. Implement your solution

This is what you've been waiting for: actually writing code! **Create a new repository** (or fork from the provided codebase) and follow these guidelines:

- Follow [clean code principles](https://workat.tech/machine-coding/tutorial/introduction-clean-code-software-design-principles-nwu4qqc63e09)
- Commit frequently (and apply [other GIT best practices](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/))
- Place comments where needed to further elaborate on your design choices

### 6. Write documentation

After you've completed your solution be sure to make your codebase as accessible to other developers as possible. This starts with **writing a great README file**. We recommend you use our [README template](https://github.com/microverseinc/readme-template/blob/master/README.md) as a starting point.

## What to do after completion

Congratulations, you've completed your take-home assignment! This is a good **time to double check** if you've covered everything:

- [ ] Fulfilled all functional requirements
- [ ] Fulfilled all non-functional requirements
- [ ] Wrote a comprehensive README
- [ ] Refactored codebase to only contain clean, functional, and finished work

After the double check, it's time to **send an email to your hiring manager**.

1. Reply to the email that contained the original take-home assignment
   a. Thank the hiring manager for the opportunity
   b. Add a link to your GitHub repository
   c. Share 1-2 insights or comments you have about the assignment
   d. Wish them a great week!

Now just **give them at least 1 week of time** to get back to you. And that's it!

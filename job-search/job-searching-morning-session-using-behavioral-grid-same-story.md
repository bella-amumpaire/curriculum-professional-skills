3. As a big group, discuss the following questions (5 mins):
   - How can you use the behavioral grid to help answer interview questions?
     If necessary, look at the sections ‚ÄúInterview preparation grid‚Äù p. 32 (only the intro) of [Chapter 5. Cracking the Coding Interview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hQZzkNB4NeJ2vejNeqjUsy9ISnDsf98U/view).

### Interviewers setup - 5 min

1. Everybody will be an interviewer during the exercise, so each of you must follow the steps below:

   - Open [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pJ8BIhi39iYl6k498xqdAR_TfZhotunao2CTqF6L6Rs/edit#gid=2041017957) and get a list of randomly generated behavioral questions.
   - Read the list of questions and select 2 that ask your partner about a past situation (usually they have the format ‚ÄúTell me about‚Äù).
   - Reflect upon the attribute that each question will help you identify in the interviewee, such as initiative, empathy, compassion, humility, and teamwork.
   - Open the [following checklist for providing feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-qHNXwhKKc5TeXAtYYZwkHwr5xGkSk2pyzxlbtsp5_I/edit?usp=sharing). Copy the 2 questions that you will be asking in section 2 and register the attribute that they will help you identify.
   - Read the criteria and indicators you will assess in the interview.

2. Split yourselves into groups of 2 and go into breakout rooms as you did [in this exercise](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/job-searching-morning-session-using-breakout-rooms-for-interview-practice.md#what-are-breakout-rooms).
   - **Set timer for breakout rooms - it should be 30 minutes.**
   - If there is an odd number of people in your group, one room will need to have 3 people.

### Collaborative preparation for interviews and quick interviews - 30 min

1. Begin by telling each other one of the questions you will ask. **Don‚Äôt share the second question!** The idea is that you will have to craft the answer without previous planning.

2. Individually, spend 5 min preparing your answer with your behavioral grid.

   - Open your behavioral grid and select one of the projects or experiences you have listed.
   - Read the different stories you created for that project or experience.
   - Then, prepare an answer for the specific question you will answer using this story using [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1skX7M4uT-lHmMFLxrvivlhzTv4hANfW8zZQzAoqdAG8/edit?usp=sharing). Write how you will structure the three elements of the SAR structure and identify keywords that will help you remember the main ideas.

3. Take turns doing the interviews. In each one, the interviewer will ask 2 behavioral questions: first, the question you shared in step 1 and then the one you haven‚Äôt shared with your partner. Follow these steps for each question:
   - The interviewer opens the [following checklist for giving advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-qHNXwhKKc5TeXAtYYZwkHwr5xGkSk2pyzxlbtsp5_I/edit?usp=sharing). **You should fill it in during the interview if possible.**
   - The interviewer starts [timer](https://vclock.com/timer/#countdown=00:03:00&date=2022-06-24T17:11:04&sound=xylophone&loop=1).
   - The interviewer asks the first question.
   - **The applicant answers using the project or experience selected and giving answers with the SAR structure.**
   - The interviewer indicates when the time is up.
   - The interviewer offers feedback to the applicant, stressing if the answer provided evidence of the attribute to be explored and explaining why it did or did not (if possible, give concrete examples). (1 min)

**Do not extend the allocated time as it is important that you practice completing tasks on time, as you will need to in your actual interviews.**

3. When you finish all interviews:
   - All interviewers complete the checklist.
   - All interviewers share a filled-in checklist with the applicant. **The applicant will use this for their exercise submission**.

### Recap with the big group - 10 min

1. Come back to the main room in Zoom.
2. Use [this Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrclyLFtL6b5fMdT) form for a self-assessment and rating for the interviewer.
3. Share something you will work on based on one piece of feedback with the entire group.

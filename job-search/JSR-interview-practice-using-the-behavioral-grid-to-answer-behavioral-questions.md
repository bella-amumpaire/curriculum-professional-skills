# Peer-to-peer interview practice: Behavioral interviews with the CARL framework

## Learning objectives

- Answer behavioral questions using the CARL framework.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise

### Instructions

```
❗️❗️❗️IMPORTANT NOTE:
In order to make the most out of this exercise you need to find a partner
who will play the role of your interviewer (in exchange you will do the same for them).
We recommend looking for a partner in your Morning session group
but you can contact anybody else from your cohort.
```

💡 **Remember that this meeting should take 1 hour, not 30 minutes.**

- Join the Zoom call with your team - remember to always be on time to respect your teammates’ time and practice respecting your interviewers’ time.
- Select a **leader** who will ensure you follow the outline below - do not skip any steps!

### Preparation - 10 min

1. In a big group, read the following information to refresh your understanding of using the CARL format to answer behavioral questions.
    - Mute your microphones and read in silence.

**Why is structuring your answers to behavioral interview questions important?**

To get to know you better and assess if you are culturally fit for the company, recruiters will ask you to describe past experiences related to issues that are important for the role you are applying for. For example, they can ask how you have dealt with conflict or communicated in interdisciplinary teams or multicultural environments to predict how you will behave in the future. Typically, these questions begin with “Tell me about…”.

The CARL (context-action-result-learning) format you studied during the job search readiness module helps you structure your answers to these questions. Practicing how to apply it to show different attributes of your personality and provide evidence of your professional performance with past examples will help you prepare for interviews.

**Refresh your knowledge by reviewing the following lesson:**

- [The CARL format](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/JSR-the-CARL-format.md)

Once everybody is ready, make a collective summary of the attributes of each element of the answer: Context, Action, Result, and Learning.

### Interviewers setup - 5 min

1. Everybody will be an interviewer during the exercise, so each of you must follow the steps below:
    - Open [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pJ8BIhi39iYl6k498xqdAR_TfZhotunao2CTqF6L6Rs/edit#gid=2041017957) and get a list of randomly generated behavioral questions.
    - Select two questions to ask your partner about a past situation (with the format Tell me about).
    - Reflect upon the attribute that the question will help you identify in the interviewee, (for example, initiative, empathy, compassion, humility, problem-solving, and teamwork). Then, identify possible follow-up questions to dig deeper into that attribute during the interview.
    - Open the [following checklist for providing feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jTBqbvLq3dVlZjFmCAmLEFWQL4A5xiGJEKp8BpDTVQ4/edit#heading=h.za7e1fwup8u). Copy the two questions you will be asking at the top of each section and register the attribute they will help you identify.
    - Read the criteria and indicators that you will assess in the interview.
2. Split yourselves into groups of 2 and go into breakout rooms as you did [in this exercise](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/job-searching-morning-session-using-breakout-rooms-for-interview-practice.md#what-are-breakout-rooms).
    - **Set timer for breakout rooms - it should be 25 minutes.**
    - If there is an odd number of people in your group, one room will need to have 3 people.

### Quick interviews - 25 min

1. In your breakout rooms, you will take turns.
    - Each of you will play the role of an interviewer once and the role of an applicant once.
2. In each interview, the interviewer will ask 2 behavioral questions following these steps:
    - The interviewer opens the [following checklist for giving advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jTBqbvLq3dVlZjFmCAmLEFWQL4A5xiGJEKp8BpDTVQ4/edit#heading=h.za7e1fwup8u). **You should fill it in during the interview if possible.**
    - The interviewer starts the [timer (**3 minutes**)](https://vclock.com/timer/#countdown=00:03:00&enabled=0&seconds=180&title=Peer+interviews+practice&sound=xylophone&loop=1).
    - The interviewer asks the first question.
    - **The applicant answers using the CARL framework.**
    - The interviewer indicates when the time is up.
    - The interviewer asks a follow-up question to dig deeper into the attribute they wish to explore and gives the applicant an additional minute to answer.
    - The interviewer starts [timer (**1 minute**)](https://vclock.com/timer/#countdown=00:01:00&enabled=0&seconds=60&title=Peer+interviews+practice&sound=xylophone&loop=1).
    - The applicant answers the follow-up question.
    - The interviewer shares with the applicant the attribute(s) illustrated by the interviewee in answer and explains why (if possible, give concrete examples). (1 minute)

**Do not extend the allocated time. It is important that you practice completing tasks promptly, as you will need to do in your real interviews.**

1. When all interviews are finished:
    - All interviewers fill out the checklist.
    - All interviewers share a filled-in rubric with the applicant. **The applicant will use this for their exercise submission**.

### Recap with the big group - 10 min

1. Come back to the main room in Zoom.
2. Use [this Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrclyLFtL6b5fMdT) form for self-reflection and the rating of the interviewer.
3. Share something you will work on based on one piece of feedback with the entire group.

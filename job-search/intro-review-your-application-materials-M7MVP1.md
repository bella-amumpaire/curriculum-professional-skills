# **Project introduction: Review your application materials to boost your job searching**

## **Learning objectives**

- Refine your application materials to verify they meet the requirements for job searching.

### **Estimated time: 0.5h**

## **Description**

This lesson will introduce you to three job searching projects that you will complete in Module 7. In these week-long projects, you will make in-depth edits to one of the key application materials required to apply for a job: resume, cover letter, and portfolio. 
The goal is to make sure that your application materials are so strong and compelling that they help you land an amazing job.

### Why is it important to review your application materials once again?
The recruitment process is a funnel, where only a small percentage of the applicants move from stage to stage. The first stage is a screening process in which recruiters look at the application materials of all candidates quickly to select the few that will be invited to an interview. Sometimes, they scan resumes and cover letters with specialized software. As a job searcher, your challenge is making sure that your materials communicate in a clear and compelling way that you are an excellent candidate for the specific role that you are applying for. This will help you get invited to interviews and technical tests, the next steps in the recruitment process.

In the final sweep, you updated and polished the format, functionality, and information of your application materials. Now, as you begin dedicating your efforts to job searching, you will work with your coach to refine their content and increase your chances of being invited for interviews when you apply for jobs.

**Investing your time and effort in refining your application materials is worth it because they help you stand out and move through the screening process successfully!** 

### How will the revision process work?

You will spend one week editing each application material:
- On week 2, your resume
- On week 3, your cover letter
- On week 4, your portfolio

Since the strengths and challenges that each job searcher faces are different, the projects have been planned to provide you with a basic strategy, but allow you the flexibility to adapt it to your personal needs and, at the same time, provide you with personalized feedback from your coach. These are the steps that you will follow:

1. In an initial exercise, you will prepare a polished version of your application material and submit it to your coach through the Student Dashboard.

2. Your coach will review the application material. After doing an in-depth analysis of the content, they will request any necessary changes. You will be able to access their written feedback through the dashboard. If the material is submitted as a Google Doc, they will also make comments directly on the document.

3. During the week, you will edit your application material. You may interact with your coach through Gdoc comments or Zendesk messages if you have questions about the changes. **Try to be as thorough as possible integrating the changes requested by your coach to optimize their time and yours**.

4. You will let your coach know that your application material is ready for another review, via a Gdoc comment or a Zendesk message. 

5. Your coach will review the changes you have made and give you feedback again. 

You might need to go through steps 3 to 5 several times: you will see time booked in the Student Dashboard for these rounds of revision. Plan for the whole process to take you between 8 and 16 hours throughout the week. 

When you and your coach agree your application material is ready, you will submit the final version through the Student Dashboard. You will find an exercise for this submission.

**In our coachesâ€™ experience, it takes several iterations to get a job searcher resume ready: expect to go through several revisions during the week.** 

### What should you do if you need more time for project changes than the amount booked for that?

The time booked for the project changes is an estimate, so it is ok if it occasionally takes you longer to complete a project. This submission of the final version of your application material is a carry-over activity. If you are not able to get your application approved by the deadline, you will be given one more week to complete it without having to repeat the block.

**Remember that the goal is to make sure that your resume is ready to successfully help you get an amazing job.**

# How will you communicate with your career coach?

üëâüèΩ¬†You can reach a coach via **Zendesk** for advice about particular jobs, job offers, networking opportunities, improving your application materials, or anything else coming up for you.

Career coaches will either help you asynchronously, or if it's something time-sensitive, especially around job offers, you'll be encouraged to schedule a short 1:1 call, so they can talk through whatever you need. In addition, coaches often meet with students to discuss how to evaluate job offers and plan negotiation strategies. Reach out to them¬†*immediately*¬†if you get a job offer so they can help you negotiate it and make the best choice for you.

As with all communication, coaches can best help you if you provide as much information as possible in your initial messages. We encourage you to give as much context as possible about any issues or potential offers you're considering. You can always use a Loom video to discuss an issue instead of typing it all out. Doing this will be excellent practice for your future remote workplace.

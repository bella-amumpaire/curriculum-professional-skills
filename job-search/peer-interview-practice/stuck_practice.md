# Peer-to-peer live coding practice: being stuck

## Learning objectives

- Demonstrate ability to deal with common issues during the live coding session part of a technical interview.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise

üí°üí° IMPORTANT NOTE: This exercise's purpose is to practice talking about your plan for coding, not doing the actual coding itself. So, remember - **do not write any code** during this interview practice.

### Instructions

üí° **Remember that this meeting should take 1 hour not 30 minutes.**

- Join the Zoom call with your team - remember to always be on time to respect your teammates‚Äô time and practice respecting your interviewers‚Äô time.
- Select a **leader** who will make sure that you follow the outline below - do not skip any steps!

### Preparation - 15 min

1. In a big group, read the theory lesson [Deal with common issues during live coding: being stuck](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/peer-interview-practice/stuck_lesson.md).
    - Mute your microphones and read in silence.
    - Once everybody is ready, make sure that everybody understands the issue that is a theme of that lesson.

### Interviewers setup - 10 min

1. Everybody in your group will play the role of the interviewer at some point during the exercise, so each of you must follow the steps below:
    - Everybody opens [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HkUyBZdcpGz_aEUa8W_rtNhS739jly8HY6sXVPPSAro/edit#gid=144653283) and gets a randomly generated quick coding challenge (a GitHub Classroom assignment).
    - Everybody makes sure that they copied the link from the spreadsheet (it will be needed during the interview).
    - Everybody accepts the selected assignment and reads its description - as all of you will be playing the interviewer role you need to get familiar with the challenge.
    - **Make sure that you understand the challenge, as an interviewer, so you can help your peer by asking some support questions.**
3. **Everybody makes themselves familiar with the [rubric for giving advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/186C2M79FjOOU24NkozGRBnww9f5Im5Zo0isLI41wYXw/edit#).**
2. Split yourselves into groups of 2 and go into breakout rooms as you did [in this exercise](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/job-searching-morning-session-using-breakout-rooms-for-interview-practice.md#what-are-breakout-rooms).
    - **Set timer for breakout rooms - it should be 25 minutes.**
    - If there is an odd number of people in your group, one room will need to have 3 people.

### Quick interviews - 25 min

1. In your breakout rooms, you will take turns.
    - Make sure that each of you plays the role of an interviewer once and the role of an applicant once.
2. In each interview, follow these steps:
    - The interviewer opens the [following rubric for giving advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/186C2M79FjOOU24NkozGRBnww9f5Im5Zo0isLI41wYXw/edit#). **You should fill it in during the interview if possible.**
    - The interviewer starts [timer (**7 minutes**)](https://vclock.com/timer/#countdown=00:07:00&enabled=0&seconds=420&title=Peer+interviews+practice&sound=xylophone&loop=1).
    - The interviewer shares a link with the applicant to the assignment with a coding challenge that they got familiar with.
    - **The applicant will need a couple of minutes to consider the challenge - take your time here.**
    - **For the purpose of this exercise you need to pretend that you are stuck at some moment.**
    - The applicant's job is to apply the following the guidelines from [Deal with common issues during live coding: being stuck](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/peer-interview-practice/stuck_lesson.md).
        - ‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: the point is not to solve the challenge/answer the question but to practice how to react in a specific difficult situation.** ‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è 
    - The interviewer confirms once they understand the applicant's approach.
    - The interviewer indicates when the time is up**.
        - Do not extend the allocated time as it is important that you practice completing tasks on time, as you will need to in your real interviews.
3. When all interviews are finished:
     - All interviewers finish filling the rubric in.
     - All interviewers share a filled-in rubric with the applicant. **The applicant will use this for their exercise submission**.

### Recap with the big group - 10 min

1. Come back to the main room in Zoom.
2. Use [this Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrclyLFtL6b5fMdT) form for a self-assessment and rating for the interviewer.
3. Share something you will work on based on one piece of feedback with the entire group.

### Submit your exercise

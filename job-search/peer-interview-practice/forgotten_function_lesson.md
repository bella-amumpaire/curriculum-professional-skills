# Deal with common issues during live coding: forgotten function


## Description

Sometimes, when you are performing the live coding part of a job interview, you might have an idea in your mind similar to this one: “Wait… for sure there was a function/method that would do the job here… but what was its name?”. Our minds are limited, and we cannot remember all functions/methods and their syntax. Especially during a stressful situation (and a job interview is a stressful situation), our memory can cause us problems. In this lesson, you will practice how to behave in such a case.

### Why is it important?

Time is important during a job interview as you are working against a clock. Reusing already existing functions and not reinventing the wheel can save you some time. Another benefit is that you will have a chance to show still that you have some piece of knowledge - even if you do not remember the details - and you are able to make use of it.

### Guidelines to follow

Review the following guidelines that will help you to make sure that you take your chance to perform better during a job interview even if you do not remember the details about some function/method.

**Context**
*You are at a technical interview. Your current task is to show your live coding skills. You are in the middle of implementing your solution with code. You know that a function/method that might help you **exists,** but you do not remember its name or which argument you should use.*

1. **Inform your reviewer about your thought process.** Tell your interviewer that you are quite sure that a function/method that might be useful at this point exists, but you do not remember its syntax.
    1. By saying this out loud, your interviewer will know what is happening in your mind.
2. **Ask if you could use Google to find the information you need**.
    1. Your interviewer may agree to that but it is better to be polite and ask. In the case of them saying “no” you will know that you at least tried.
    2. Another possible scenario is that your interviewer can simply give you a hint and this is also a good outcome.
3. **Show your Googling skills.** Remember to use precise keywords. You can also try programmers-specific websites, e.g. StackOverflow.
    1. Remember that making use of the Google search engine is also an important skill that can help you to show off.
4. When you figure out the name of the function, **check it in the official documentation** to make sure that you know how to use it (which arguments are required).
    1. Thanks to that you will avoid problems with some unverified function/method usage examples that might exist somewhere on the Internet. In addition, you will also show that you are able to read and use documentation.

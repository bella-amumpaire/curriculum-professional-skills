# Deal with common issues while answering technical questions: mind-blanking

## Description

What should you do when you are getting so nervous that you feel like your mind is empty - even if you know that you knew the answer?
First of all, you need to remember that [mind-blanking happens to everyone](https://thepracticalpsych.com/blog/mind-blanking#What%20is%20a%20blank%20mind:~:text=As%20stated%20below%2C%20mind%2Dblanking%20happens%20to%20everyone.%20We%20may%20even%20be%20in%20a%20state%20of%20mind%20blanking%20up%20to%2018%25%20of%20the%20time%20(2)).
As it is a known issue, you can easily deal with it.

### Why is it important?

A job interview is a stressful situation by definition and mind-blanking can add to your stress level.
Knowing how to manage your stress level will help you to present yourself better.

### Guidelines to follow

Review the following guidelines to help you overcome the mind-blanking issue.

**Context**
*You are at a technical interview. You are in the middle of answering a technical question or maybe the question was just asked. 
All of the sudden you feel like your mind is empty - even if only seconds ago you knew the answer!*

1. **Acknowledge that your mind went blank.**
     - This will buy you some time to take a pause, breathe, and remind yourself that this is an issue that could happen to anybody (these are [the first 3 steps listed by Dr. Jason Spendelow](https://thepracticalpsych.com/blog/mind-blanking#The%20four%20step%20strategy)).
     - In addition, your interviewer will be aware of the situation.
2. **Ask for rephrasing the question.** This is the first step. Maybe when asked differently, the question becomes clear to you (this is [the last step listed by Dr. Jason Spendelow](https://thepracticalpsych.com/blog/mind-blanking#The%20four%20step%20strategy)?
    - For example: *Could you rephrase the question?*
3. If nothing helps - **simply ask to go to the next question and to come back to the current question at the end of the interview**.
    - For example: *I am sorry. I am sure that I know the answer but my mind is still empty. Can we move to the next question and come back to this one at the end?*

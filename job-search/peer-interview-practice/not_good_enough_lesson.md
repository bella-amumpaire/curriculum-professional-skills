# Deal with common issues during project presentation: not good enough

## Description

Presenting your project from the past might be considered the easiest part of the technical interview as you can prepare for it in advance.
However, even in this case, your stress level can be your worst enemy. This lesson will help you to prepare for the situation when you have a feeling that your project is simply not good enough.

### Why is it important?

As humans, we tend to underestimate our efforts as we usually can see many things that could have been done better.
Of course, being humble and aware of the things that can be improved is a good characteristic for a programmer to have.
It is easy to exaggerate this though. If you are too strict with yourself and become stressed, you can give up on yourself too early.
You must give yourself an opportunity to present your past work even if you feel like it is not good enough - remember, there is a big chance that this feeling is false.

### Guidelines to follow

Review the following guidelines that will help you to overcome the feeling that your project is not good enough.

**Context**
*You are going to have a technical interview. You are preparing for a project presentation. You are worried that your project is not good enough.*

The first thing to remember is that most likely you will **always** feel this way. Even experienced programmers have this feeling.
Why is it happening? First of all, as a programmer you constantly learn new things. So when you go back to your projects from the past you can see things that you did in not the most optimal way.  And you did it because when you wrote that code you had less knowledge. Actually, you should be worried if you think that your projects from the past are perfect - that can be a sign that you are not improving your skills!

The second reason is that as a programmer you will support projects from very different domains. Therefore, it is very likely that each time you will face a challenge that is unique for that specific domain. And unique problems do not have easy solutions ready, they must be solved with a tailored approach. Even if you follow all best practices and design patterns, you will need to invent something new and react to unexpected issues. When you look at this kind of project in retrospect -  at a later time when you finally do understand all challenges and limitations of the supported process because you already went through them - it is easy to think that something should be done differently. The problem is that your past self did not have the knowledge that you have now.

After this pretty long intro that aims to give you a different perspective, take a look at the guidelines that will help you to prepare your "not-good-enough" project for presentation:

1. **Find the good parts of your project and present them with confidence**. It can be the architecture, a method/function that solves an interesting problem, well-thought through tests, clean and/or well-organized parts of your code.
2. Take an advantage of the pieces of your projects that you consider "not good enough." You can use them to show that you have improved since the moment that this project was created. **Find the weak parts of your project, think about how you would improve them today, and present your ideas.**
   - For example, you can say: "This is actually code that I would write differently today. Instead of *doing X*, I would *do Y*."

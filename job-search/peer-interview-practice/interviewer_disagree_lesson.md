# Deal with common issues while answering technical questions: interviewer disagrees with your approach

## Description

Job interviews are stressful for many reasons. While normally you will stress about your own behavior, there might be a moment when your interviewer makes you feel uneasy.
Imagine that you are answering a question with full confidence but your interviewer's behavior tells you that you said something wrong.

In this lesson, you will learn how to react to this kind of situation.

### Why is it important?

During job interviews, you want to keep your focus in order to present yourself from your best side. A feeling that you are saying something wrong can take you off the track.

### Guidelines to follow

Review the following guidelines that will help you make sure that you do not start coding abruptly.

**Context**
*You are at a technical interview. You are in the middle of answering a technical question. You feel confident about your answer but your interviewer seems to disagree - for example, they shake their head.*

First of all, remember that your interviewer's behavior might not indicate that your answer is wrong:
   - For example, in some Balkan countries people [shake their heads to show agreement](https://www.contiki.com/six-two/nodding-head-bulgaria-means-no/#:~:text=In%20Bulgaria%20nodding%20your%20head,in%20many%20countries%20means%20no.) while in other countries it usually means saying 'no.'  
   - There is also a chance that the interviewer's behavior has nothing to do with your answer. Imagine that they are sitting in the office and someone opens their door - your interviewer may be trying to show that person that they are busy by shaking their head.
     
Having that in mind will help you reduce your stress level.

Then take the following actions:
1. **Finish your current thought in the way you planned initially.**
2. **Acknowledge your feeling and confirm your impression.** Ask your interviewer politely if they agree with you:
    - For example: *Excuse me, it looks like you do not agree with me. Is this impression correct?*
3. If the interviewer confirms your impression, **ask for additional information and continue the discussion with your interviewer**. You can use some of the following questions:
    - *Can we make sure that I understood this question in the right way? Let me rephrase it.*
    - *Can you tell me which part I am getting wrong?*
    - *Can you tell me why you think that my approach is not the best one?*
4. Otherwise - **continue with your answer from the moment you stopped**.
5. In both cases - **thank your interviewer for additional clarification**.

# Deal with common issues during live coding: in rush

## Description
During the live coding part of your job interview, you will be working against a deadline. Sometimes you will get just enough time to solve the challenge and sometime it won't be enough.
It is easy to stress out when you can see that the time is up and being stressed surely does not help you think faster.
Luckily even if you feel in rush and you already know that you wonâ€™t implement the solution in a reasonable amount of time, you can still present yourself well.

### Why is it important?

Under time pressure, you can give up on yourself even before your interviewer does. It is important to use any chance to show that you are a professional and a valuable programmer.

### Guidelines to follow

Review the following guidelines that will help you overcome the challenge of limited time for a coding challenge.

**Context**
*You are at a technical interview. You are solving a coding challenge but you can clearly see that you won't finish your code on time. If you had more time, you would solve it for sure.*

1. **Acknowledge that you think that you won't be able to finish your code on time.**.
     - This will buy you some time to take a pause, breathe, and remind yourself that this is an issue that could happen to anybody.
     - In addition, your interviewer will be aware of the situation.
2. **Describe what the next steps are in your plan for a solution.** If you do that you will show that you are capable of solving the challenge.
3. **Ask if it is possible to get more time or to finish the code async.** If you do not ask you can miss your chance.
4. **Go back to coding. Implement as much as possible in the given time.**

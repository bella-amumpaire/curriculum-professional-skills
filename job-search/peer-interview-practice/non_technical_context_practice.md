   ](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/peer-interview-practice/non_technical_context_lesson.md).
3. Split yourselves into groups of 2 and go into breakout rooms as you did [in this exercise](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/job-searching-morning-session-using-breakout-rooms-for-interview-practice.md#what-are-breakout-rooms).

   ](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/peer-interview-practice/non_technical_context_lesson.md).** - ❣️❣️❣️ **IMPORTANT: the point is not to present the whole project but to practice how to react in a specific difficult situation.** ❣️❣️❣️ - The interviewer indicates when the time is up\*\*. - Do not extend the allocated time as it is important that you practice completing tasks on time, as you will need to in your real interviews.

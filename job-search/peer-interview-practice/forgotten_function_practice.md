# Peer-to-peer live coding practice: forgotten function

## Learning objectives

- Demonstrate ability to deal with common issues during the live coding session part of a technical interview.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise

### Instructions

💡 **Remember that this meeting should take 1 hour not 30 minutes.**
- Join the Zoom call with your team - remember to always be on time to respect your teammates’ time and practice respecting your interviewers’ time.
- Select a **leader** who will make sure that you follow the outline below - do not skip any steps!


### Preparation - 15 min

1. In a big group, read the theory lesson [Deal with common issues during live coding: forgotten function](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/peer-interview-practice/forgotten_function_lesson.md).
    - Mute your microphones and read in silence.
    - Once everybody is ready - make sure that everybody understands the issue that is a theme of that lesson.

### Interviewers setup - 10 min

1. Everybody in your group will play the role of the interviewer at some point during the exercise, so each of you must follow the steps below:
    - Everybody opens [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HkUyBZdcpGz_aEUa8W_rtNhS739jly8HY6sXVPPSAro/edit#gid=1813173909) and gets a randomly generated link to some method/function description.
    - Everybody reads the documentation and makes sure they understand how to use the selected method/function.
    - Everybody creates a simple challenge that requires the usage of selected method/function.
        - Example: for the [String.repeat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/repeat) function, the challenges might be as simple as:
            - Repeat the text “I can solve every challenge with only one function!” as many times as the number of chars in your name.
2. If you need to share some code with your peer, you can use [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/signin) and its [live sessions](https://codesandbox.io/docs/live) mode.
3. **Everybody makes themselves familiar with the [rubric for giving advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ILBaV5vpVC1FKsyCVA5iwDPFeh0fNlKh9eOS7g_2yzE/edit#).**
4. Split yourselves into groups of 2 and go into breakout rooms as you did [in this exercise](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/job-searching-morning-session-using-breakout-rooms-for-interview-practice.md#what-are-breakout-rooms).
    - **Set timer for breakout rooms - it should be 25 minutes.**
    - If there is an odd number of people in your group, one room will need to have 3 people.

    
### Quick interviews - 25 min

1. In your breakout rooms, you will take turns.
    - Make sure that each of you plays the role of an interviewer once and the role of an applicant once.
2. In each interview, follow these steps:
    - The interviewer opens the [following rubric for giving advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ILBaV5vpVC1FKsyCVA5iwDPFeh0fNlKh9eOS7g_2yzE/edit#). **You should fill it in during the interview if possible.**
    - The interviewer starts [timer (**7 minutes**)](https://vclock.com/timer/#countdown=00:07:00&enabled=0&seconds=420&title=Peer+interviews+practice&sound=xylophone&loop=1).
     - The interviewer gives the applicant two challenges and tell them which coding languages the challenges require. The applicant can select which coding challenge they want to solve.
    - As an applicant, by getting a trivial challenge for an obscure method from your interviewer, you should be in a similar situation as you would be in an interview when you forget a method. You can apply all the strategies from the theory lesson.
    - **The applicant job is to apply the guidelines from [Deal with common issues during live coding: forgotten function](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/peer-interview-practice/forgotten_function_lesson.md).**
        - - ❣️❣️❣️ **IMPORTANT: the point is not to solve the challenge/answer the question but to practice how to react in case of a specific difficult situation.** ❣️❣️❣️ 
    - The interviewer indicates when the time is up.
        - Do not extend the allocated time as it is important that you practice completing tasks on time, as you will need to in your real interviews.
3. When all interviews are finished:
     - All interviewers finish filling the rubric in.
     - All interviewers share a filled-in rubric with the applicant. **The applicant will use this for their exercise submission**.
    
### Recap with the big group - 10 min

1. Come back to the main room in Zoom.
2. Use [this Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrclyLFtL6b5fMdT) form for a self-assessment and rating for the interviewer.
3. Share something you will work on based on one piece of feedback with the entire group.
    

### Submit your exercise

[Read this FAQ for a reminder on how to submit your exercise.](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234)
Now go to your Student Dashboard and submit your exercise.

Paste the link to the rubric with advice that was filled in by your interviewer (thanks to that you will be able to come back to them at any point) from your dashboard.

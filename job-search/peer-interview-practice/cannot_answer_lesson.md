# Deal with common issues while answering technical questions: cannot answer a question

## Description

There are a few strategies that can help you answer a question in a difficult situation. For example, [when you don't understand the question](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/peer-interview-practice/not_clear_question_lesson.md) 
or [when you experience a mind-blanking](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/peer-interview-practice/mind_blanking_lesson.md).
However, sometimes you simply do not know the answer to a question.
Even if this situation occurs you can still behave in a way that proves your professionalism. 

(Hint: ask for the correct answer, as it shows that you are interested and you can still add something to the answer once you recall the concept).

### Why is it important?
Of course, the perfect scenario is an interview in which you can answer EVERY question. You work hard to make that happen.
However, there is always a chance that you will get a question that you are not able to answer.
In that case, you should be able to act professionally and show that you are capable of improving your skills.

### Guidelines to follow

Review the following guidelines that will help you to act in a professional way in case you do not know the answer to a specific question.

**Context**
*You are at a technical interview. You have just heard a question and you know that you cannot answer it*

1. **Acknowledge that you do not know the answer.** Say it aloud, so your interviewer is aware of the situation.
2. **Ask your interviewer for a correct answer and mention that it can help you to improve.** That will show that you are interested in programming and committed to becoming a better web developer.
    - For example: *Would you mind telling me the correct answer? I am curious to know the answer, and I think it will help me to improve my skills.*

*If you spot any bugs or issues in this activity, you can [open an issue with your proposed change](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/open_issue.md).*

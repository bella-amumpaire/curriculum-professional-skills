### Why is using breakout rooms for interview practice important?

You will begin practicing how to answer technical interview questions during morning sessions. If there are 4 or more learners in a session, you will need to work in pairs in order to practice answering as many questions as possible. So, you will use Zoom's breakout rooms that are completely separated from the main meeting session.

ðŸ’¡ **Morning sessions will be one hour long to enable you to complete the technical interview practice.** 

### What are breakout rooms?

Breakout rooms are like mini Zoom meetings within your main Zoom meeting in which a subset of participants interact with full video, audio, and screen share capabilities. They are a great tool to use when attendees need to participate in small-group activities and discussions.

### How to setup breakout rooms for interview practice

Breakout rooms will help you get into pairs or groups of 2 specifically for behavioral practice, technical question practice, and project presentation practice.

# Common issues students face during technical job interviews

During technical job interviews, you will experience quite a few stressful moments. To help prepare you for this, we have collected a list of common issues that our job searchers have faced.

They are divided into three groups - each group is connected with a different part of a technical job interview.

Remember that the issues listed below might happen to everybody - especially during such a stressful situation as a job interview. If that happens to you, it does not mean that you will be rejected. What is more - you can even take an advantage of them!

# Common behavioral issues during job interviews

Job interviews can be stressful and it's easy to let our emotions get the best of us. However, it's important to present our best selves during a job interview, as it can have a significant impact on our chances of landing the job.

Unfortunately, several common _behavioral_ issues can occur during a job interview, which can negatively impact our chances of getting hired. Here are **4 common behavioral issues** that you should be aware of during your next job interview, as well as **suggested solutions to mitigate them**.

## 4 Common behavioral issues

### Issue 1: Being anxious

**Anxiety** is one of the most common issues that arise during a job interview. It can cause you to stammer, speak too fast, or make mistakes.

To overcome this issue, it's important to **relax yourself** before you go into an interview. A great way to do so is by meditating, breathing exercises or taking a power nap.

### Issue 2: Lack of preparation

A **lack of preparation** is another common issue that can arise during a job interview. This can include:

- Not researching the company
- Not knowing the details of the job you're applying for
- Not being able to answer questions related to your experience and skills

To overcome this issue, it's important to **research the company** and the job description to know what you're applying for, as well as to **prepare answers to common interview questions**.

### Issue 3: Passivity

**Being passive** and just waiting for the interview to pull information out of you is another common issue.

This is undesirable because it can give the impression that you lack _confidence_, _motivation_, and _initiative_.

Employers are looking for individuals who are proactive, engaged, and have a clear understanding of the role they are applying for.

To overcome this issue, be sure to be **energized** when you start the interview. Once it starts, you should show **enthusiasm** and **curiosity** by asking questions yourself and trying your best to make the interview feel like a dialogue.

### Issue 4: Poor Communication Skills

**Poor communication skills** is another reason why interviews don't go well. With this, we mean _not making eye contact_, _speaking too softly or too loudly_, or using* too many filler words* such as "um" or "like".

To improve your communication skills, **practice speaking clearly and confidently**, and be mindful of your body language.

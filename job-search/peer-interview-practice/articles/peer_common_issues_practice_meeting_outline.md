# Peer-to-peer interview practice: general meeting outline

💡 **Remember that this meeting should take 1 hour not 30 minutes.**

- Join the Zoom call with your team - remember to always be on time to respect your teammates’ time and practice respecting your interviewers’ time.
- Select a **leader** who will make sure that you follow the outline below - do not skip any steps and keep track of time!

### Preparation - 15 min

1. In a big group, you should read the theory lesson about the specific issues.
   - Mute your microphones and read in silence.
   - Once everybody is ready - make sure that everybody understands the issue that is a theme of that lesson.

### Interviewers setup - 10 min

1. Review special instructions included in the specific exercise.
2. Everybody in your group will play the role of the interviewer at some point during the exercise, so each of you must follow the setup instructions provided in the specific exercise.
3. If you need to share some code with your peer, you can use [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/signin) and its [live sessions](https://codesandbox.io/docs/live) mode.
4. **Everybody makes themselves familiar with the [rubric for giving advice] (provided in the specific exercise).**
5. Split yourselves into groups of 2 and go into breakout rooms as you did [in this exercise](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/job-searching-morning-session-using-breakout-rooms-for-interview-practice.md#what-are-breakout-rooms).
   - **Set timer for breakout rooms - it should be 25 minutes.**
   - If there is an odd number of people in your group, one room will need to have 3 people.

### Quick interviews - 25 min

1. In your breakout rooms, you will take turns.

   - The interviewer shares the question/challenge with an applicant.
   - The applicant answers the question/challenge by following the guidelines for the specific issue.
     - ❣️❣️❣️ **IMPORTANT: the point is not to solve the challenge/answer the question but to practice how to react in case of a specific difficult situation.** ❣️❣️❣️
   - The interviewer indicates when the time is up.
     - Do not extend the allocated time as it is important that you practice completing tasks on time, as you will need to in your real interviews.
3. In the end, the interviewer should share a filled-in rubric with the applicant. The applicant will use this for their exercise submission.

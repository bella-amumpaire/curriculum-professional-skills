# Deal with common issues during live coding: example input

## Description

One of the common mistakes that people make in the live coding part of technical job interviews is misunderstanding the requirements.
It results in perfect code that does not do what it is supposed to do.
A very silly example can be a task to find all even numbers in an array but you make a mistake and you write a code to look for the odd numbers.
If you or your interviewer only realize the mistake after you write your code, it might be too late to make corrections.
One of the easiest strategies to prevent this kind of issue is to come up with an example input and output of your code.

### Why is it important?

If you confirm what the expected output is before starting to code, you will make sure that you and the interviewer understand the coding challenge in the same way at the very beginning. It is much better than jumping into coding some solution and realizing that you misunderstood something in the middle of solving it.
This wastes precious interview time, which is important when working against a deadline.
In addition, providing an example can also help you to figure out the solution.

### Guidelines to follow

Review the following guidelines that will help you make sure that you know how to confirm the expected output with your interviewer.

**Context**
*You are at a technical interview. Your interviewer has just shared a coding challenge with you.*

As always, before taking any action, read the coding challenge description. Then apply the following guidelines:

1. **Write down example input and expected output**. You can use pseudocode or just make a note as a comment in your code.
    - For example: if your task is to count all even numbers in an array, you can write down:
        - Input: [2,5,7,8,34], output: 3
        - [22,13,67,29,11]  ---> 1
2. **Confirm with the interviewer that your understanding is correct**. Do it with a written text as it is less prone to misunderstanding.

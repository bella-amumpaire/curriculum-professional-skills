# Deal with common issues during live coding: a new tool

## Description
During the live coding part of the technical job interview, you will need to show your programming skills.
To do that you can share your screen and use your IDE or you might be asked to use a specific online tool.
The latter is a common practice because many online platforms support the recruitment process from start to finish.

While all online coding tools serve the same goal, each of them can be a little bit different.
As using a tool that can be completely new for you can add to your stress level, it is good to try out different ones and practice how to get familiar with new tools quickly.

### Why is it important?

A job interview is stressful by itself and it is important to minimize the stress caused by other factors.
One of those factors can be as trivial as an online tool that you have never used before, and is easy to overcome.

### Guidelines to follow

Review the following guidelines that will help you make sure that you set up yourself for success when using an online tool that is completely new for you.

**Context**
*You are at a technical interview. Your interviewer asks you to use a specific online tool for solving a code challenge. As you have never used it before it makes you a little nervous*

1. **Start with identifying the most important parts of the tool**. Look for:
    - A place to write code.
    - A place to see the output (it can be an HTML page, a result of Ruby script, console output).
    - A place to see test results.
2. **Find out how to run the code**. Write something as simple as "Hello world" and run it.
3. **Check how you can debug your code if necessary**. 
   - Are there any debugging tools like `pry` available? Or maybe you can just use `puts` or `console.log`.
   - Try out all options as they can be useful for solving challenges.

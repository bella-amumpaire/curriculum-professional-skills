# Deal with common issues while answering technical questions: don't understand the question

## Description
Many times during job interviews, you will find yourself in a situation when you do not understand the question or it takes you a significant amount of time to understand it. 
There is nothing wrong with that - it can also happen to the most experienced web developer.
However, it is important that you do not freeze and instead, you continue with the conversation as a professional.

### Why is it important?
Even if you do not understand the question, you can still show the way you think and how you communicate. 
Imagine that you are already employed in the company that is interviewing you - being able to admit that you do not understand something
and making an effort to understand it would be a very valuable skill.

### Guidelines to follow

Review the following guidelines that will help you to make sure that you do not freeze when you do not understand a question.

**Context**
*You are at a technical interview. You have just heard a question. You do not understand what have you been asked for though.*

1. **Acknowledge that you did not understand the question.**  Say it aloud, so your interviewer is aware of the situation.
2. **Ask for rephrasing of the question.** This is the first step. Maybe - when asked in a different way, the question becomes clear to you?
    - For example: *Excuse me, I did not understand the question. Could you rephrase it?*
3. If you still do not understand the question **open the discussion by listing the things that you did understand and did not understand**.
    - For example:
        - Question: *Describe CRUD verbs and actions.*
        - *I understand the CRUD acronym - it comes from Create, Read, Update, and Delete. However, I am not sure what you mean by verbs and actions.*
   - **When you start with what you know, that you will show that you have some knowledge of the subject.**
4. **Ask a question that can open a discussion with the interviewer**. This will show that you are able to talk with your future teammates in order to solve problems. 
    - For example: *Could you give me a small hint?*
    - For example: *Am I going in a good direction?*

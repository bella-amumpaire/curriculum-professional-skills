# Deal with common issues during interviews: intro

## Learning objectives

- Learn about common issues that occur during technical job interviews.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

During technical job interviews, you will experience quite a few stressful moments. To help prepare you for this, we have collected a list of common issues that our job searchers have faced.

As the best way to prepare yourself is through practice, we created a set of activities that you will perform with your peers. Thanks to these activities you will experience those stressful situations in a friendly environment first.

This week we will focus on the live coding part of job interviews as many Micronauts have shared that this was the most difficult part of the technical job interview.

### Why is it important?

During your job interviews, you will be under big pressure and you will need to overcome some of the common issues we identified. By practicing parts of the job interviews in advance, you will make yourself more comfortable with job interviews and raise your chances of performing well and landing that amazing next role.

### How to prepare for peer-to-peer interview practice

_IMPORTANT NOTE: Today, you **do not** need to perform any peer-to-peer interview session. Your current task is to get yourself familiar with the outline of this kind of meeting, so you can smoothly perform it with your team in future activities._

- Read [the list of common issues students face during live coding interviews](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/peer-interview-practice/articles/common_issues_during_interviews.md).
  - There is no need to read all articles linked in this list. You will be asked to read them one by one and do it during the morning sessions.
  - Today, just read the list and think how likely all of those issues could happen to you.
- Read the article: [How to deal with common issues during interviews - peer-to-peer practice](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/peer-interview-practice/articles/peer_common_issues_practice_meeting_outline.md).
- Last but not least: sign up for [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/signin) and read about [Live sessions](https://codesandbox.io/docs/learn/getting-started/collaborate-share). If you need to share your code with your peers and collaborate together, it will be perfect!

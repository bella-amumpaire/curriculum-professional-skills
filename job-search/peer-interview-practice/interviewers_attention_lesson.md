# Deal with common issues during project presentation: interviewer's attention

## Description

Presenting your project from the past might be considered the easiest part of the technical interview as you can prepare for it in advance. However, even in this case, your stress level can be your worst enemy. This lesson will help you to prepare for the situation when you can see that interviewer does not follow your presentation.

### Why is it important?

While presenting your project you would like to see your audience paying attention to what you are saying. If that is not the case you can feel less confident and more stressed. While someone's attention or distraction is not always your fault, you can still double-check and make sure that your presentation is engaging. It can help you to make a good impression.

### Guidelines to follow

Review the following guidelines that will help you to make the most out of a situation in which you get the impression that your interviewer does not follow your presentation.

**Context**
*You are in the middle of the technical interview. You are presenting your project but all of the sudden you can see that your interviewer does not follow your presentation.*

There might be many reasons for your interviewer not paying the attention to your presentation. They might be lost because something you said was confusing for them. They might also not feel really engaged. Another possible reason might be some random situation outside the interview - maybe somebody has just knocked on the door with important information.

No matter what the reason was you can draw your interviewer's attention by following these guidelines:

1. ** Make sure that everything you said was clear.** If necessary, provide an additional explanation.
    - For example: *Excuse me: is everything clear?*
2. Alternatively - **ask some engaging questions**. Try to think about something unique about your app and share it in the form of a fun fact question.
    - For example: *If you were a user of this website, would you consider this feature useful?*
    - For example: *Did you know that motorcycles can speed up to more than 300km/h?*
    - For example: *Would you expect that one single method can require 11 unit tests?*

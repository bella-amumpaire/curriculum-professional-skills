# Deal with common issues during project presentation: non-technical context

## Description

Presenting your project from the past might be considered the easiest part of the technical interview as you can prepare for it in advance. However, even in this case, your stress level can be your worst enemy. This lesson will help you to prepare for the situation when you forget about the non-technical context of your project.

### Why is it important?

When you focus too much on the technical part of the project it is easy to forget that the purpose of the project is obvious only to you.
Your interviewer will have no idea what your code is supposed to be doing and because of that, it might be difficult for them to understand your decisions.
In addition, by showing that you are able to work on the code while taking into account other people engaged in the project - your teammates, your clients, the end-users - you can prove that you are not only a skillful person but also a valuable team member.

### Guidelines to follow

Review the following guidelines that will help you to prepare for presenting the non-technical context of your project.

**Context**
*You are going to have a technical interview. You are preparing for a project presentation. You are so focused on the technical part of your project that you are worried that you won't present the non-technical context in an effective way.*

Remember that a technical interview aims not only at checking your hard skills but also shows whether or not you can solve technical problems with a team.
You can be the most skilled programmer on the Earth but if you are not able to work with your teammates and clients, the value that you can provide will be much lower. In order to quickly and effectively prepare the part of the presentation about the non-technical knowledge you can use the following guidelines:

1. First, **explain what the project is about and what you learned by completing it**. It will be nice if you mention which domain knowledge you gained as it will make your presentaiton more engaging. Maybe you built a website for a motorcycle business and you learned something interesting about motorcycle engines?
    - For example, you can say: *"This is a website for managing space travel. Before working on this project I did not know that SpaceX data is available via public API - we can actually check which missions are realized by the SpaceX fleet."*
2. **Show your project from the user's perspective**. Walk through the main features and show what a user can do with your website. When you do that your audience will be better prepared for following your code as well.
3. **Talk about at least one collaboration challenge and how you overcame it**. This will show you as a good team member. You can consider the following areas:
    - Agreements about the project in the initial phase: how did you plan the structure of your project? How did you split tasks?
    - Conflicts between team members: when some of you wanted to do things differently than others, how did you resolve the issue?
    - Git conflicts in your projects: how did you decide on the pieces of code that were merged into the main branch?
    - Delays: how did you approach delays as a team? How did you approach delays caused by a specific team member?

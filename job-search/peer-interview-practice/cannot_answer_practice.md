# Deal with common issues while answering technical questions: cannot answer a question

## Learning objectives

- Demonstrate ability to deal with common issues during the technical question part of a technical interview.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise

### Instructions

💡 **Remember that this meeting should take 1 hour not 30 minutes.**

- Join the Zoom call with your team - remember to always be on time to respect your teammates’ time and practice respecting your interviewers’ time.
- Select a **leader** who will make sure that you follow the outline below - do not skip any steps!

### Preparation - 15 min

1. In a big group, read the theory lesson [Deal with common issues while answering technical questions: cannot answer a question](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/peer-interview-practice/cannot_answer_lesson.md).
    - Mute your microphones and read in silence.
    - Once everybody is ready, make sure that everybody understands the issue that is a theme of that lesson.

### Interviewers setup - 10 min

1. Everybody in your group will play the role of the interviewer at some point during the exercise, so each of you must follow the steps below:
    - Everybody opens [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HkUyBZdcpGz_aEUa8W_rtNhS739jly8HY6sXVPPSAro/edit#gid=2041017957) and gets a randomly generated question (select a question that you like, everything but the 3rd row is a valid question for this exercise).
    - Everybody reads the selected question and looks for an answer - as all of you will be playing the interviewer role you need to get familiar with the questions.
    - **Make sure that you, as an interviewer, can answer the question so you can help your peer by giving the correct answer.**
2. **Everybody should make themselves familiar with the [rubric for giving advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ghWQITmBHrVT-h9OGM_FaO4UOiaiR31Ypmw5fCGjCbg/edit#).**
3. Split yourselves into groups of 2 and go into breakout rooms as you did [in this exercise](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/job-searching-morning-session-using-breakout-rooms-for-interview-practice.md#what-are-breakout-rooms).
    - **Set timer for breakout rooms - it should be 25 minutes.**
    - If there is an odd number of people in your group, one room will need to have 3 people.

### Quick interviews - 25 min

1. In your breakout rooms, you will take turns.
    - Make sure that each of you plays the role of an interviewer once and the role of an applicant once.
2. In each interview, follow these steps:
    - The interviewer opens the [following rubric for giving advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ghWQITmBHrVT-h9OGM_FaO4UOiaiR31Ypmw5fCGjCbg/edit#). **You should fill it in during the interview if possible.**
    - The interviewer starts [timer (**7 minutes**)](https://vclock.com/timer/#countdown=00:07:00&enabled=0&seconds=420&title=Peer+interviews+practice&sound=xylophone&loop=1).
    - The interviewer reads the question aloud.
    - **The applicant acts as if they do not know the answer for the purpose of the exercise. The goal is to practice the guidelines so they will become a natural reaction for you if this issue happens during a real interview.**
    - **The applicant's job is to apply the following guidelines from [Deal with common issues while answering technical questions: cannot answer a question](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/peer-interview-practice/cannot_answer_lesson.md).
        - ❣️❣️❣️ **IMPORTANT: the point is not to answer the question but to practice how to react in a specific difficult situation.** ❣️❣️❣️ 
    - The interviewer indicates when the time is up**.
        - Do not extend the allocated time as it is important that you practice completing tasks on time, as you will need to in your real interviews.
3. When all interviews are finished:
     - All interviewers finish filling the rubric in.
     - All interviewers share a filled-in rubric with the applicant. **The applicant will use this for their exercise submission**.

### Recap with the big group - 10 min

1. Come back to the main room in Zoom.
2. Use [this Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrclyLFtL6b5fMdT) form for a self-assessment and rating for the interviewer.
3. Share something you will work on based on one piece of feedback with the entire group.

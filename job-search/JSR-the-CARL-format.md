# The CARL framework

## Learning objective:

- Answer common behavioral questions in the CARL format.

### **Estimated time**: .5h

## Description

In this lesson, you will learn the CARL format, an alternative framework to answer behavioral questions.

### Why should you learn the CARL format?

Showcasing your ability and potential to develop as a software developer is one of the crucial aspects that recruiters assess in behavioral interviews. A common mistake our career coaches have identified in Micronauts’ behavioral grid is forgetting to talk about the long-term impact of their past experiences, thus missing the opportunity to highlight their ability to learn and grow. Since CARL explicitly includes the “L” for learning, it will help you remember to consider this aspect in your stories.

### Overview of CARL

CARL considers four elements in answers to a behavioral question.

**Guiding questions:**

- Why is CARL different from SAR?
- Why do recruiters ask behavioral questions?
- What are the two key attributes of an answer to behavioral questions?
- How should you present the context - C?
- What information should you include as A - actions?
- What are some examples of quantitative and qualitative results - R?
- Why should you try to state quantitative results - R?
- What does the L start for?

### Guiding questions and examples for the 4 elements

In the following webpage from Edinburgh University, review the guiding questions you can use when thinking about each element of the CARL model and analyze some examples:

- [The CARL model of reflection](https://www.ed.ac.uk/reflection/reflectors-toolkit/reflecting-on-experience/carl#:~:text=better%20for%20you.-,Context,-Here%20you%20will)

**Guiding questions:**

- What information should I provide in each of the four elements?
- What are the main attributes in the examples for each element?

### Example of an excellent behavioral grid

Read through the following examples of behavioral grid answers using CARL. Analyze how each answer is structured and identify the information included in each component.

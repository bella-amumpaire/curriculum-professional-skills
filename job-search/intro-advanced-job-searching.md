### Estimated time: .25hr

## Description

Welcome to advanced job searching at Microverse! In this lesson, we will go over what you should expect from this module and what we expect from you. 

### Why is this module important to you?

Job searching can be challenging when looking for your first job or a new position to drive your professional career forward. It might take longer than you thought and require you to face a lot of rejection along the way. So, you must keep your spirits up and work consistently towards getting the right job. 

This module supports you by:
- Reminding you the essential tasks that you need to focus on and refreshing your memory about how to perform them,
- Offering you opportunities to practice your interview and coding skills,
- Providing you personalized feedback on your job search plan and goals, and
- Giving you access to a community of job searchers with whom you can interact and share experiences.

### How is this module structured?

The daily schedule includes critical tasks for job searching. Although the activities are repetitive, we present them on your View Progress Page as a road map to help you ensure you omplete them consistently. To give you flexibility, most of the activities are skippable, and you can skip an unlimited number in each block.

In this module, you will only have a space to meet with peers in morning sessions. You can use  them topractice technical and behavioral interview skills with other job searchers.  Notice there are no daily standups nor learning partners.


### How will career coaches support you?

A career coach will review the assignments you submit and give you feedback:
- Your job searching SMART goals.
- Your analysis of your job search.
- An application material (optional).

Also, if you have specific questions, you may get in touch with a career coach via Zendesk or request a 1:1 meeting and you can attend the coaching events that our career coaches will facilitate periodically.

### How will you track your progress while job searching?

The indicators during your job search will be the number of applications you submit and the interviews you participate in. The metrics for the last 7 days will appear at the top of your Progress View page and reflect the information you register in Huntr.

 **Refer to this article for a refresher on how to use Huntr:**

### What do we expect of you?

To help you, our career coaches need to know how you are job searching, your achievements, and your blockers. So, to maintain your status as an enrolled job searcher, we require you to complete the required activities in the curriculum by the end of the week:
- Reassess your job searching SMART goals (week 1),
- Analyze your job search (week 4),
- Weekly retrospective (every week).

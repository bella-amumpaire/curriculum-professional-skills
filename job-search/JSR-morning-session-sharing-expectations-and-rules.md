# Sharing expectations and setting rules for interview practice this week  

## Learning objectives

- Recognize the importance of investing in good working relationships with teammates.

### **Estimated time**: 1hr

## Description

Today you're going to share with your teammates your expectations about morning sessions and you will set working agreements on how you will support one another this week.

*Read through the following section on your own while staying on the Zoom call with your group. Spend 10 minutes on this section individually*

### Why is it important to set agreements with your team about morning sessions?

Preparing for job searching and going through the job searching process will be intense and challenging. You may start getting anxious and tempted to rush into sending applications. Later on, you may start feeling lonely and uneasy, especially if you don’t get invited to interviews and you don’t receive any feedback from recruiters. In other moments, if you get several interview invitations or take-home exams in the same week, you can feel overwhelmed, stressed, and uncertain about handling the situation. The support of your peers will help you overcome difficult moments, so it’s important to develop strong relationships with other Micronauts that will share the experience with you.

This week, during morning sessions, you will practice interview skills with your group. Their feedback and support will help you prepare yourself to interact successfully with others while you job search. To benefit from this practice, it's important that you first get to know each other, discuss the support you expect to get from your teammates and set some basic agreements on how you will help one another.

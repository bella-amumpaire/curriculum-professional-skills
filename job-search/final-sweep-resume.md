# Final Sweep: prep your resume

## **Learning objectives**

- Create a strong resume that will pass applicant tracking systems.

### **Estimated time: 2h**

## **Description**

In this exercise, you'll look at your resume and make any necessary edits before submitting it to your coach for review.

## Why is it important to make one last round of revisions before submitting your resume to your coach?

You've used the curriculum and project revision process to create your resume and improve it substantially using the feedback from reviewers. Yet, there might be some mistakes, out-dated information, links that don’t work, or areas of improvement that you or the reviewer didn’t notice. The goal of the final sweep is to identify anything that you might have missed, to correct or update it. It's also intended to catch any errors that may have been accidentally introduced in previous editing processes.

## Project setup

- Open up your resume in Google Docs
- Open all written and numerical resume feedback from your project reviewer(s). You can find written feedback on your dashboard for each project under the **Action-->View Reviews** button.
- Open the [resume rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lxBFRdvPW_cLQpX8n_gj8O8t1XPcXjGTDOCI813Uga0/edit).
- Open the [walkthrough to create the first draft of your resume](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/create-the-first-draft-of-your-resume.md).

## Do a final sweep of your resume

To review your resume, it is important to read it through several times, looking at specific attributes each time, and making the necessary changes:

1. First, observe carefully the format of your resume. Is it readable and attractive? Does the template that you chose work well for the information you are presenting? Are the styles are applied consistently?
2. Check that all links function properly.
3. Read the resume through a first time and analyze if it provides a clear picture of your knowledge, skills and experience. Make note of information that might be missing.
4. Using the rubric, verify that each section meets the requirements. Refer to the resume walkthrough if you have questions about a particular section. Identify phrases that seems confusing and rewrite them if necessary. Update or add any information that was missing (and that you identified in the previous step).
5. Check the spelling and grammar one more time. Grammarly is a great resource for this!
6. Finally, look at the feedback that you received from your reviewers and verify that you made all the corrections they requested.
7. Read it carefully one more time to make sure that you didn’t miss anything.

**Keep a record of all the edits that you made to your resume in the final sweep so that you can integrate them into other application materials, in particular, your Linkedin, Wellfound or GitHub profile.**

## Submission instructions

- Save this new version of your resume in Google Drive with the file name: Final_sweep_resume_yourname.
- You don’t need to submit the revised version of your resume now. You will do one final submission of all of your application materials. It is quite probable that, as you review other application materials, you may want to come back and make some changes in the resume.
- When you finish reviewing your resume, go the Student Dashboard and mark this activity as completed.

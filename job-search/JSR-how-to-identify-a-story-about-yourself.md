# How to identify a story about yourself

Begin by looking back at your past, and identifying a situation or event that you want to describe. Remember that it should be something that you have enjoyed, that has given you satisfaction, a sense of accomplishment. Consider your “whole” life, including professional activities, but also those that you do outside of work, such as hobbies, classes, social events; anything that you enjoy!

If you are staring at a blank screen ad don’t know where to start, look at the list of ideas that others have used to create their story:

“*As I look back, I realize I chose a story that…*

- *Is somehow abnormal or inconsistent with the rest of my life*
- *Reveals my skills in a public way*
- *Is in a field (such as leisure, learning, etc.) far removed from my work*
- *I remembered through or because of its outcome*
- *Represented a challenge/gave me pride because it was something:*
- *I previously could not do*
- *My friends could not do*
- *I was not supposed to be able to do*
- *Only my father/mother could do, I thought*
- *Only authorized/trained experts were supposed to be able to do*
- *Somebody told me I could not do*
- *My peers did not do/could not do*
- *The best/brilliant/famous could or could not do*
- *I did not have the right degree/training to do*
- *People of the opposite sex usually do*
- *I would like to do again:*
- *In a similar/different setting*
- *With similar/different people*
- *For free for a change/for money for a change*
- *Excited me because:*
- *I never did it before*
- *It was forbidden*
- *I took a physical risk*
- *I was taking a financial risk*
- *No one had ever done it before*
- *It demanded a long and persistent (physical/mental) effort*
- *It made me even with someone*
- *I loved doing because:*
    - *I kind of like this sort of thing*
    - *The people involved were extremely nice*
    - *It did not cost me anything*
- *Will support/justify the professional goals I have already chosen”*

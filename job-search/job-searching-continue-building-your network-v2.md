# Job Searching - Continue building your network

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

In this exercise, you will continue building your network during the job search process. It will be an activity that constantly appears on your Progress View Page to remind you to invest some time every day for this purpose. Read thoroughly this text the first time you open this activity; afterwards, you can only submit your network tracker and refer to this information as you need it.

If you need information about who to network with or how to network, look at the resources we include further below.

### Why is continuing to build your network important?

You cannot build a solid professional network in one day. Creating and nurturing relationships with other people requires dedicated effort and time. First, you must identify those peers with whom you want to interact, reach out to them, and develop mutual trust and understanding.

### Networking as gardening

A helpful framework for understanding the dedication and constant activities involved in networking is Greg Bahlman’s GARDNER framework. Familiarize yourself with the seven key elements of networking in the article:

- [Don’t just network: become a relationship gardner](https://tribemineblog.com/dont-just-network-become-a-relationship-gardener/).

**Refer to this article if you feel lost or less motivated to network!**

## Useful information for networking

### Who to network with?

Networking will seem like a shot in the dark if you don't have target companies and people to network with. The key to efficient networking is to network with people a) you're interested in connecting with and b) who have the potential to make an impact on your job search. Identifying prospects for networking will require research. Read the following article for ideas:

[Use research to plan a better network](https://tribemineblog.com/use-research-to-plan-a-better-network/)

Another way of finding prospects for your network is by looking at your list of dream companies.

**Refresher on your dream companies list:**

- [Define your dream companies](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/define-your-dream-companies.md).

Whenever you identify someone you want to contact, you can register them in this [List of networking contacts (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Toq6By43e3Hd6zaOZKISATp3fkdCmOERAxlZKVM7Tjk/edit?usp=sharing). Initially, you might only have some information. Don’t worry; you can complete other details as you continue researching and communicating with them.

### **Instructions**

_Check out this FAQ if you need a refresher on [Google Doc submission best practices](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063156813)_

To review your resume, it is important to read it through several times, looking at specific attributes each time, and making any necessary changes:

1. Begin by looking at the feedback that you have received from your reviewers and verifying that you have made all the corrections they requested.

2. Carefully observe the format of your resume. Does it follow the template you chose? Are the styles applied consistently? Is it readable and attractive?

3. Check that all links function properly.

4. Read through the resume a first time and analyze whether or not it provides a strategic picture of your knowledge, skills, and experience that position you as an outstanding software developer. Identify phrases that seem confusing and rewrite them if necessary. Make a note of information that might be missing and figure out a way to add it. Identify anything that is not essential and eliminate it.

5. Read your resume again, and this time check the spelling and grammar carefully. Grammarly is a great resource for this!

6. Now, analyze whether or not you meet each and every one of the requirements of the [resume rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lxBFRdvPW_cLQpX8n_gj8O8t1XPcXjGTDOCI813Uga0/edit). Use the [Assess your resume rubric worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vCBlhu1NlNKuj2KAct1EZI_nMU1vkd6QU60rUiUUqD0/edit?usp=sharing) to register your scores and find learning resources that you can use to improve your resume. **You don’t need to submit this worksheet**. Keep it at hand as a reference during this week’s round of revisions.

7. Read your resume one more time to make sure that you didn’t miss anything. Your resume should now be ready for your career coach to review!

**Keep a record of all the edits that you made to your resume in the final sweep so that you can integrate them into other application materials, in particular, your Linkedin, Wellfound or GitHub profile.**

### Submit your exercise

_Read [this FAQ](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234) for a reminder on how to submit your exercise._

Now go to your Student Dashboard and **submit the link to your resume** for your coach to review and comment. Remember to submit your material by Wednesday of the week it's due so that career coaches can review it on time.

NOTE: **You don't need to submit the worksheet.** It is intended to help you assess if your resume meets the requirements in the rubric.

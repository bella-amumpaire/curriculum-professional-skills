### Why is scheduling your industry professional mock interview important?

In this module, you have self-assessed your potential challenges during interviews, learned how to prepare for the interview, refreshed your knowledge about answering technical and behavioral interview questions, and practiced intensively both type of questions with your peers. It's time to assess the mastery of the interview process you have achieved!

Your industry professional mock interview is an opportunity to have an interview with a professional software developer. This will give you the feeling of what an actual interview is like and prepare you for the real interviews you will have in the future. Also, your interviewer will give you feedback at the end of the session and you will be able to check your score for the different questions. You will also find recommended resources to prepare yourself better.

### How do you schedule your industry professional mock interview?

1. **Define the best possible dates for your interview.** You should complete the industry professional mock interview this week, before the end of the block to avoid a repetition. 

    Plan carefully the best day for you to attend, considering the moment where you will have access to good connectivity, and a quiet and professional environment. If your internet is unstable, the interviewer will not be able to go through the interview and assess your skills; thus, you will receive a score of 1. 

2. **Schedule your meeting.** Through your Student Dashboard, you will access Calendly to select the date and time for your interview. Follow these steps:
    - Go to your "View Progress Page", and find this activity.
    - Click on the "Actions" button that appears at the right-hand side. 
    - Select the "Schedule interview" option. 
    - On the Calendly page that appears, select a day that suits your schedule, based on the step above. 
    - Choose the time.
    - Fill in your name and email address. Note: you must use the same email address you use for the Microverse Student Dashboard. 
    
      **Calendly will send you a confirmation with the the interviewer's name, the date and time, and the link for the interview. Please take a screenshot and submit it in this activity** 

      **NOTE** - If you are unable to complete any of the steps above, or you cannot find availability within the required timeframe, please reach out to Student Success right away, so we can help you figure this out and ensure you attend your industry professional mock interview.

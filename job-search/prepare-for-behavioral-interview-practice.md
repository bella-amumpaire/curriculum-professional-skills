# Prepare for behavioral interview practice

## Learning objectives

- Understand what to expect in an interview process.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

In this lesson, you will refresh your understanding of behavioral interviews to prepare yourself for the peer-to-peer practice sessions we have designed to help you prepare for this kind of interview.  

### Why is it important to practice for behavioral interviews?

Job interviews include behavioral questions that help recruiters know you better. They aim to explore how you behave in specific situations, considering how you have approached past problems. Your answers will impact the interviewer’s perception of you as a potential employee for the position. Sometimes, this might determine whether they decide to hire you.

As with other skills, **practicing makes the master!** This is true, especially for situations where you will be under pressure and are likely nervous. In addition, familiarity with the process and strategies you can apply will help you perform better. It’s like when you learned to ride a bike or drive a car. In the beginning, it seemed very difficult to tend to so many things simultaneously. But with constant practice, you started mastering parts of the process so that you performed them automatically. The interview practice sessions aim to offer you daily opportunities to practice your interview skills.

### How will the behavioral interview practice sessions work?

These practice sessions will take place in the morning sessions. Each one will target particular aspects of behavioral interviews. We will give you detailed instructions and resources to guide you through carefully structured practice, including:
- A review and discussion of essential concepts with your peers.
- Setting up the interview.
- Interviewing each other and providing feedback with a checklist.
- Discussing aspects to improve.

Sometimes, the session will include moments where you prepare the answers to questions using resources available to you.


### How to prepare for behavioral interview practice sessions

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Today, you **will not** practice your interview skills. Your current task is to refresh your knowledge about behavioral interviews, so you can smoothly participate in the peer-to-peer behavioral interview practice that will take place during morning sessions.*

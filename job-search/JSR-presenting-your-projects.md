# Presenting your projects

## Learning objectives

- Learn and practice vocabulary and techniques for introducing yourself to different types of professionals with confidence.
- Communicate clearly and effectively in spoken English.
- Communicate technical concepts to other technical people.

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Description

```
‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏èIMPORTANT NOTE:
In order to make the most out of this exercise you need to find a partner
who will play the role of your interviewer (in exchange you will do the same for them).
If you have a learning partner(s) assigned this is the way to go!

Otherwise, we recommend looking for a partner in your Morning session group
but you can contact anybody else from your cohort.
```

As a professional developer you'll have to present your work often: to fellow engineers, but also other professionals such as designers or project managers.

In this exercise you'll practice **presenting your projects** in the right way and adapt according to the audience you have in front of you.

### Structure of a good project presentation

A good presentation **starts of high level** and **non-technical**. Depending on your audience, you should go into the technical details or not.

1. Provide a high level description
   - What problem does the app solve?
   - What is the used tech stack?
   - What are 1-3 key features?
2. Show a demonstration of the app
   - Demonstrate the use of the 1-3 key features

_(only continue from here if your audience is technical or if they are interested)_

3. Introduce the codebase
   - Explain the architecture of the files and folders
4. Explain the flow of the 1-3 key features
   - Describe your implementation approach
   - Present the code (from file to file)
5. Answer any question your audience might have

## Preparatory work

In order to do this exercise well make sure you follow these steps beforehand:

1. Choose a project
2. Get familiar with the codebase
   - Architecture
   - Implementation details of key features
3. Make a presentation outline _(use the one from the section above!)_
4. Practice presenting

When practicing, here's what we recommend you do:

- Practice your presentation **at least 3 times**
- Make sure to have an **audience**, or if there's no one available, **use a mirror** and talk to yourself (it might sound silly but it actually works!).
- Use a **timer** to make sure you dedicate sufficient time for each section

## Exercise

> üí° Please make use of the [following rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xiSBJv6G8VK1g9c-P8YScDzGuOK5Bho6kr34wmnz2fo/) while you go through the exercise.

This exercise is done with a peer in a **mock interview setting**. Select one person to start and follow the instructions:

1. Provide a high level description - **(5 min)**
2. Show a demonstration of the app - **(5 min)**
3. Introduce the codebase - **(5 min)**
4. Explain the flow of the 1-3 key features - **(15 min)**
5. Answer any question your audience might have - **(5 min)**
6. Interviewer gives feedback - **(10 min)**
7. _Switch roles and repeat_

‚è∞ Time: 45 minutes per person

**Guiding questions:**

- Is the interviewer following every step of your thought process?
- Are you touching only the most relevant, important points?
- Are you keeping track of the time?

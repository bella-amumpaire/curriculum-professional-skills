# Refresher: technical and behavioral interviews

## Learning objectives

- Understand what to expect from the interview process

### **Estimated time**: 0.5h

## Description

An interview for a software development position always consists of 2 component: a **technical** and **behavioral** assessment. In this lesson you'll get a quick refresher on each in terms of:

1. Their end goal
2. How to best approach them
3. What to do during the interview

## Technical interviews

A technical interview is an interview designed to assess **your technical ability for the role**, as well as **the depth and breadth of your knowledge** in your chosen field.

### Goals of a **technical** interview

You can't apply for a software development role if you don't have the technical understanding required. During a technical interview, the interviewer is trying to figure out...

_Is this person..._

- ...technically competent?
- ...able to solve problems?
- ...communicating their thought process?

### How to approach a **technical** interview

To best prepare yourself for the technical interview you should **take ample time (at least 1-3 months) to prepare yourself technically**.

- Have a coding interview study plan
  - [Recommended approach](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-study-plan/)
- Use flashcards to sharpen conceptual understanding
  - [Flashcards - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Ruby, Rails & SQL](https://www.brainscape.com/p/4TZVB-LH-CKNZ1)
- Build 1-3 small to mid-sized projects
  - [Project ideas](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/more-project-ideas-to-improve-your-coding-skills-99f48d09bb4b/)

### What to do during a **technical** interview

Here are some quick tips to succeeding at a technical interview:

- Think out loud and verbalize your thought process
  - It's more important to show how you got to a certain conclusion than the answers themselves
- Ask clarifying questions
  - This shows a willingness to learn from others as well as helping you solve the problem faster
- Listen to your interviewer and to their suggestions
  - When you are coachable you are easy to work with
- If you don’t know the answer, take a few minutes to think about it
  - Stress gets to everyone, just relax and try your best

## Behavioral interviews

A behavioral interview is an interview designed to assess non-technical skills required by the position, such as **time management**, **teamwork**, and **emotional intelligence**.

### Goals of a **behavioral** interview

You might be a genius at writing code, but if you can't work together with others in the right way it's going to be a challenge. During a **behavioral** interview, the interviewer is trying to figure out...

_Can this person..._

- ...fit in well with the company culture?
- ...recognise the importance of teamwork and communication?
- ...handle stress, failure, or conflict well?

### How to approach a **behavioral** interview

To best prepare yourself for the behavioral interview you should learn **how to best present yourself**.

- Prepare your answers to commonly asked questions
  - Having clear and personalised answers to these questions shows you as a confident person with experience
- Practice the CARL framework
  - When presented with situational questions, this framework will help to structure your answers in the most informative way
  - [The CARL framework](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/JSR-the-CARL-format.md)
- Research the company and learn more about their values
  - Showing a deep interest in the company helps with ensuring a culture fit

### What to do during a **behavioral** interview

Here are some quick tips to succeeding at a behavioral interview:

- Apply the CARL framework
  - This structure will inform the interviewer of many positive things about you
- If you don’t know the answer, take a few minutes to think about it
  - Stress gets to everyone, just relax and try your best
- Ask questions back
  - This is a perfect opportunity to get to know the interviewer (on a human level) too!
- Keep your answers short
  - Only share the most important details. If the interviewer is curious they'll ask for more

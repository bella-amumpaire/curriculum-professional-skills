# Update and polish your LinkedIn profile

## **Learning objectives**

- Create a clear, compelling LinkedIn page.

### **Estimated time: 2h**

## **Description**

In this exercise you will revamp your LinkedIn page to ensure it sets the stage to create a compelling story about you as a junior developer with the necessary skills to grow in any company. Then you will submit it to a career coach for review and approval. The coach will offer you feedback and request changes if necessary. 

**Your LinkedIn page must meet all the requirements of the rubric and be approved by a career coach to complete the block.**

You have:

- **A maximum of two reviews**, so study the coach’s comments carefully and integrate any changes required. If necessary, you may use one of your extra reviews.

- **One week to complete the activity** and avoid a block repetition. 

❗️ Submit your first version **no later than Wednesday of the week it's due** to have time to go through the necessary rounds of revision. 

Coaches might take up to 3 days to send you their comments and request changes.

## A refresher about the relevance of a LinkedIn profile

LinkedIn is one of the most used platforms for hiring professionals so crafting your profile carefully and keeping it updated and active can impact your chances of being invited to interviews. You can also find job postings on LinkedIn, meet and interact with other professionals, and build your personal brand by sharing your knowledge.

Your LinkedIn page consists of a header, a summarized introduction to who you are, and different sections with specific attributes. You already filled out all these sections in a previous module. To prepare for job searching you must update it and ensure it presents the skillset you bring to a position and your potential to contribute to a company and grow as a software developer. Also, if you publish posts regularly, your page can also show that you are an active professional.

A compelling LinkedIn page will help you get invited to interviews!

## Show your technical expertise by categorizing your skills correctly

When listing your technical skills, it's essential to use the correct technical terms. For example, programming languages and frameworks are NOT the same! So differentiating them clearly in your application materials is a good way of showing your mastery of technical concepts. Read the following article for more information:

- [How to use correct technical terminology in application materials](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/style-guide-technical-terminology-in-application-materials.md)

Guiding questions:

*Think about these questions as you learn about improving your ability to state your knowledge and skills.*

- Am I categorizing my skills correctly?
- Did I make sure to follow a style guide when writing my skills down?
- Would my audience be convinced of my technical expertise if they saw my application materials?

## Project setup

- Open up your LinkedIn profile.
- Open the [Assess your LinkedIn profile rubric and worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wYhgEHVtL9yixkmTde7058JGcmrd5fywWucFszyE9b8/edit?usp=sharing)

## **Exercise**

### **Instructions**

Analyze and score the following sections of your LinkedIn page:

- Header
- About section
- About — Featured subsection
- About — Activity subsection
- Experience section
- Education section
- Skills section
- Recommendations section
- Projects and publications sections
- Spelling, grammar, and organization

For each section:

1. First, **update** the information. You have developed new projects and mastered new skills since you created your LinkedIn profile!
2. **Read** the requirements for the first section in the [Assess your LinkedIn profile rubric and worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wYhgEHVtL9yixkmTde7058JGcmrd5fywWucFszyE9b8/edit?usp=sharing) carefully.
3. **Analyze** whether your LinkedIn page meets each requirement.
4.  **Register your score.** Jot down any possible areas of improvement.
5. **Review** the tips and suggested learning resources to find ideas for improving to your LinkedIn page.
6. **Make changes** to your LinkedIn profile.
7. *Continue with the next section.*

❗️**Important note:** Once you have finished all sections, verify that your visibility settings will let career coaches and recruiters see your email. Follow these steps:
- Click on your profile at the upper right corner.
- Select "Privacy and setting".
- Click on "Visibility".
- Select "Who can see or download my email".
- Set email visibility to "Anyone on Linkedin".
It's a good idea to check other visibility options also since you are job searching.

Once you believe your LinkedIn page satisfies all the requirements, **submit it to your coach** for review. Don't waste your time and the coaches' by submitting a profile that hasn't been reviewed and updated!

### Submit your exercise

*Read [this FAQ](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234) for a reminder on how to submit your exercise.*

Now go to your Student Dashboard and submit the **link to your LinkedIn Profile** so a coach can review it and give you feedback. You don't need to submit the worksheet.

**Submit this exercise by Wednesday at the latest.** Remember that:
- Your LinkedIn profile should be approved by a coach to avoid a week repetition.
- You may need to go through 2 rounds of review for approval.

# Update and refine your portfolio

## **Learning objectives**

- Improve your personal portfolio site.
- Add a new project to your portfolio.

### **Estimated time: 6-10h**

Today, we have set up 3 hours to start this activity. There is time booked other days for this purpose. The total time to invest depends on your specific needs.

## **Description**

In this activity, you will make your portfolio website **more unique** and update your showcased projects to ensure it compellingly represents your skills and is ready to share with recruiters.

After you’ve upgraded your website, you will then **submit it to a career coach for review**. Your coach will send you feedback and request changes if necessary.

Your portfolio **must be approved** to complete the module successfully. You have:

- **3 weeks** to go through the review process, because this activity is a module requirement. 
- **2 rounds of reviews only**. So, study the coach's feedback carefully and **integrate all changes before re-submitting your portfolio**. 

❗️ Submit your first version **no later than Wednesday of the week it's due** to have time to go through the necessary rounds of revision. 

Coaches might take up to 3 days to send you their comments and request changes.


## Refresher on what makes a good portfolio

Your portfolio website serves 2 purposes:

1. **Convince employers:** Employers want skilled developers. A portfolio website proves that you have the skills it takes to do the job.
2. **Differentiate yourself:** The labor market is a competition. With your unique portfolio website you can show potential employers who you are and why they should work with you and not others.

As you have learned, portfolios come in all sorts of shapes and colors, but solid and compelling ones share four attributes:

- They are **simple**: there’s no extraneous information, only basic background information, contact information, and a project showcase.
- They are **visual**: they use screenshots, mockups, live demos, and other visual tools to show the viewer what you’re capable of making.
- They are **thorough**: while the design itself may be simple, they make use of links (both in-text and otherwise) to show extra background information about the work, projects, and history.
- And they **look good**: they use 1-3 elegant fonts, focus on 2-4 different colors, use high quality images, and use color palettes that are attractive and harmonious.

Rewatch the video [What makes a good portfolio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-N6O7DVrbc) to review some examples.

## Learn by example

A great way to learn what to aim for is by looking at **good examples**. Here are some portfolio websites from other Microverse students we found effective:

- [https://abdulali3468.github.io/MY_PORTFOLIO](https://abdulali3468.github.io/MY_PORTFOLIO/)
- [https://elsonotake.github.io/Portfolio/](https://elsonotake.github.io/Portfolio/)

There are also many other projects found on the internet that you can take inspiration from:

# Project setup

- Open up the latest version of your portfolio.
- Open the [Assess your portfolio rubric and worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QCI3eNjdXghP_ZjNVmUZq0DO9hKovbbRp2FsAWdVVuU/).

## **Exercise**

### **Instructions**

Analyze and score your portfolio website. You will take a look at **6 types of requirements**:

- Design
- Content
- Interactivity
- Device support
- Language
- Projects

You are probably thinking that these are too many steps. But you would be surprised at how much a well-polished portfolio will impact your job opportunities!

For each section you need to:

1. **Read** the requirements carefully.
2. **Compare** each requirement with your portfolio website.
3. **Identify** if your portfolio meets each requirement.
4. **Add** your assessment in the “Score and areas of improvement” (see example in the rubric). Include any possible areas of improvement.
5. **Use** the suggested resources (or any other ones within the Microverse curriculum).
6. **Improve** your portfolio website.
7. _Move on to the next section and repeat!_

After you scoring, your should **make improvements** to your portfolio, until you believe it satisfies all requirements.

Only after you’ve done this should you proceed to **submit it to your coach** for review.

## Submit your exercise

_Read [this FAQ](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234) for a reminder on how to submit your exercise._

Now go to your Student Dashboard and submit the **link to your portfolio** so your coach can review it and give you feedback.

Please note that you don't need to submit the worksheet, the link to your portfolio!

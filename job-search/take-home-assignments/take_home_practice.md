# Take-home assignment practice

## Learning objectives

- Understand what to expect from a take-home project during an interview.

### Estimated time: 4h

## Exercise

As mentioned in the [Take-home assignment practice: intro](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/take-home-assignments/take_home_prep.md), there are **2 ways** you can prepare for take-home assignments:

- You can practice your coding skills - you never know what the task will be as usually it will be very specific for a company you are applying for. However, with each app you create, you are making yourself better prepared for any task.
- You can prepare GitHub templates for different tech stacks - this will speed you up as you will have your boilerplate code ready.

As this exercise is a recurring one, each time you will be able to select one of the **2 options**:

- Solve a random take-home assignment.
- Create a GitHub template based off of your previous projects.

**It is your responsibility to select the option for a given day!**

### Option A - instructions

1. Look for a take-home assignment (spend up to 0.5h on this) by browsing the following search result on GitHub:

- [All repositories written in Ruby that include the phrase "take-home"](https://github.com/search?l=Ruby&q=take-home&type=Repositories)
- [All topics tagged as take-home-test (Ruby)](https://github.com/topics/take-home-test?l=ruby)
- [All repositories written in JavaScript that include the phrase "take-home"](https://github.com/search?l=JavaScript&q=take-home&type=Repositories)
- [All topics tagged as take-home-test (JavaScript)](https://github.com/topics/take-home-test?l=javascript)

2. Remember to check the license - make sure that you are not using the repo and violating the license rules.
3. Read the requirements and assess if this is your level. If the task seems to be above your level, you can still challenge yourself with it.
4. Clone the repo, so you can work on the code in your local environment.
5. Timebox yourself [set up a timer for 3h](https://vclock.com/timer/#countdown=03:00:00&title=Take-home+assignment+practice&sound=xylophone&loop=1).
6. Do as much as possible in 3h:
   - Write down a plan for your solution.
   - If something is not clear, make assumptions and document them well (as there is no one to ask questions).
   - Code and remember to show the quality:
     - Remember the best practices.
     - Remember to write tests.
     - Remember GitHub best practices - clear commit messages, usage of branches, and pull requests.
     - Remember to document everything clearly - in GH commit messages, in PRs description, in the README file.
7. After 3h stop and prepare your documentation so that it includes (spend up to 0.5h on this):
   - The plan you made and what you managed to achieve and did not achieve.
   - The assumptions you made.
   - A description of any issues that arose.
   - Your suggestions for the features you could build on top of the assignment if you had more time.
8. Add the documentation you created in the previous step to the README of your assignment repo.

**NOTE**: the point of this practice is to learn how to timebox your coding, so please follow the instructions and do not extend the time limits. However, if some assignment seems to be very interesting to you, feel free to continue with it during the next take-home session.

### Option B - instructions

1. Check [how to create template repositories in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository).
2. Read [Setting up Future Projects for Success with Template Repositories](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/how_to_build_github_starter_templates_for_Eleventy_to_make_your_projects_easier).
3. Create a template repository that will be the most useful for you.

### Submit your exercise

[Read this FAQ for a reminder on how to submit your exercise.](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234)
Now go to your Student Dashboard and submit your exercise.

Paste the link to the repo with your take-home assignment or with your template.

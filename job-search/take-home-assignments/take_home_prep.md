# Take-home assignment practice: intro

## Learning objectives

- Understand what to expect from a take-home assignment during an interview.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

During the recruitment process, you might be asked to complete a take-home assignment. This part of the interview is a great way for the employer to see your work and also for you as a candidate - **you can see what kind of tasks might wait for you in that job**.

The take-home assignment is a bit more comfortable than solving a challenge in a live meeting because **you have more time to think about it** and **nobody is watching you**, so it takes some pressure off of you.

On the other hand, the **take-homes are usually more complex tasks than coding challenges**. With coding challenges you can practice by solving a lot of them, and the chance that you will get one that you have already solved in the past is decent; but in the case of a take-home assignment, most likely you will get a task tailor-made for the kind of business your future employee is doing. That adds a big level of uncertainty to the task, which when paired with the limited time you have to complete the task, can stress you out.

Luckily, you can still make yourself more confident regarding take-home assignments. Like with everything, you can master it by** practicing and by using the advice of people who are a bit more experienced than you**.

### Why is it important?

As mentioned above, take-home assignments are a great opportunity for both employer and candidate, as this task is the closest to the real tasks that you would complete if you got hired. You can show all your technical and non-technical skills and present your true self as a programmer and team member while completing the take-home assignment.

### How to prepare mentally for take-home assignments?

Imagine you're told to do a take-home assignment in a few days, and you only get 24 hours to do it. Your first reaction might be that of fear!

However, you should let go of that as soon as possible because **it will interfere with your ability to apply your skills**.

That's why we suggest the following tips to help you prepare **mentally** so that you can later just focus on the task at hand.

## 1. Relax and take your time

We know it is easy to say but... **stressing about time will only take your mental powers**. Remind yourself that the point is to show what you can achieve in a given time and focus on doing as much as possible.

The following are quotes from real take-home assignments that explicitly say that finishing the task in the given time is **not** a must-have:

     > Given the time expectations of this exercise, we don't expect anyone to submit anything super fancy, but if you find yourself with extra time, any extra credit item(s) that showcase your unique strengths would be awesome!

     > Up to 8 hours. We do not expect you to complete the assessment at this time.

     > Note II: Timeboxing is part of this exercise too. In normal circumstances, you would have more than 3 hours to work on something like this. However, even in real life, we seldom have as much time as we want to work on things. Donâ€™t let perfect be the enemy of done.

If after reading this you still feel the time pressure, remember that often **it is possible to ask for more time**.

### 2. Schedule time aside for complete dedication

If you know you'll get an assignment next week, make sure to **clear your schedule for at least 3 consecutive days**. This way you can mentally prepare yourself already for what's to come.

This will also give you peace of mind: you know that you'll be completely free from distraction and ready to give it your all.

### 3. Ask peers about their experiences

You're not the only one who is going or has gone into this experience. You **have access to many experienced peers** within the Microverse community.

Sometimes, it can provide much comfort just hearing about other people's experiences. And who knows, you might learn a handy tip or two along the way!

### 4. Research the topic

Much has been written about how to best approach take-home assignments. **Do some research** and learn more about how to better approach them!

- Last but not least, watch part of the video of Lunch & Learn with Katarzyna Skonieczna, who shares her experience with a take-home assignment in which she made a mistake as she misunderstood the requirements, and... that's why she got hired! - [![Take home](https://img.youtube.com/vi/iwJJ5oSt5ZE/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/iwJJ5oSt5ZE?t=1925)

### How to prepare practically for take-home assignments?

Now it's time to get our hands dirty. Here are a few tips to help you prepare **practically** so that you'll feel more capable when the assignment arrives.

### 1. Prepare yourself technically

This is both **having a good theoretical understanding**, as well as the **practical ability to implement** core concepts into code. That way you won't be wasting your time looking up what those mean and you can just focus on the important thing: the take-home assignment!

We recommend that you **build a simple CRUD application (i.e. a todo-list)** as a good starting point. From there you should adapt according to the type of job you've applied to.

### 2. Do some other take-home assignments

If you search GitHub, you'll find dozens of take-home assignments from companies all over the world. Find ones that **match the tasks for the role you're applying for** and try to do them. You might get an assignment very similar to it!

### 3. Have peers review your code

Whether it's a side project, a completed take-home assignment, or some old work: **have peers review your code** (and you can review theirs!). This has several benefits:

- You'll get **reminded of the best practices**
- You'll make sure to **write sufficient unit tests**
- You'll do a better job **documenting everything clearly**

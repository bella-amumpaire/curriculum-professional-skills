# Strengthen and update your resume

## **Learning objectives**

- Create a strong resume that will pass applicant tracking systems.
- Apply the principles of storytelling when job searching.

### **Estimated time: 2h**

## **Description**

In this project, you will prepare the **strongest possible version** of your resume and ensure it presents the **unique combination of skills and attributes** that help you tell your story when applying for a job. Resumes and profiles are the documents recruiters use to filter out candidates in the first stage of the recruitment process. A strong resume will help you stand out among others and get you to interviews. It’s the data you can use to convince a recruiter that you are the best candidate for the job.

Then, you will submit your resume to a career coach for review and approval. You have:

- **A max 3 rounds of review.**
- **Two weeks to get your resume approved** because this activity is a carry-over. 

❗️ Submit your first version no later than **Wednesday of the week it's due** to have time to go through the necessary rounds of revision. 

Coaches might take up to 3 days to review your work and send their comments. Please consider that refining a resume is a complex task, and you may need 3 reviews to get it right!

## **Refresher: the three main components of a resume**

Review this video lesson to ensure you understand a compelling resume's key attributes before working on this exercise.

- [Learn about the three main components of a strong resume (video lesson)](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/learn-about-the-three-main-components-of-a-strong-resume-video-lesson.md)

So your main challenge is to **select the specific information that will tell your story** and include it in your resume. It’s not figuring out a way to make ALL that you have done and know in one or two pages. 

Your story is about a skilled software developer with technical and transferable skills (which you identified last week). Now, reflect upon which experiences and educational experiences have contributed to this professional development, and describe them in simple and synthetic ways.

## About templates

You may be asking yourself, should I stick to one of the suggested templates? Can I change it or design my own? There is no simple answer to these questions.  Each format prioritizes different information. Depending on your professional career, it might be useful to highlight one section or others. For example, if you don’t have much experience or are making a career change, you might focus more on your education and skills. 

The best resume design one that helps you:

- shows who you are -skills and attributes- and what you have achieved professionally, and
- sets the stage for your next job, because a recruiter can imagine your path (where you come from and where you are going).

With this idea in mind, refresh your knowledge about resume formats and look again at some templates. As you do, try to identify which one helps YOU tell your story and analyze if there are some elements of others that you want to integrate. 

We will require you to use one of these templates, but you may adapt some sections slightly to better tell your story.

## Categorize your skills correctly

Remember it's essential to use the correct technical terms in your resume. For example, programming languages and frameworks are NOT the same! So differentiating them clearly in your application materials is a good way of showing your mastery of technical concepts. Refer to the following article if you need more information:

- [How to use correct technical terminology in application materials](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/style-guide-technical-terminology-in-application-materials.md)


## Project setup

- Open up the latest version of your resume in Google Docs.
- Open the [Resume rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zbluw7oamzhFy40XR3nzbs6ZayK-iKEa2Y3AMJ1QDWY/edit?usp=sharing).
- Open the [style guide for listing your technical skills](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/style-guide-technical-terminology-in-application-materials.md).


## **Exercise**

### **Instructions**

Analyze and score your resume carefully using the rubric. Whenever you find it doesn't meet a requirement, make the necessary changes You will focus on 6 **types of requirements**:

- Template
- Summary
- Skills section
- Experience section
- Education section
- Formatting

Please note that there are only 6 sections, but **some include many requirements!** So this activity will take some time. 

We want your materials to help you stand out and be invited to interviews. **Why wait until the absence of invitations makes you wonder if your resume is strong?** Our career coaches will provide you with feedback to help you create a strong resume now.

For each section, you need to:

1. **Read** the requirements carefully.
2. **Compare** each requirement with your resume.
3. **Identify** if your resume meets each requirement.
4. **Add** your assessment in the “Score and areas of improvement” (see example in the rubric). Include any possible areas of improvement.
5. **Study t**he tips, examples and suggested resources (or any other ones within the Microverse curriculum).
6. **Improve** your resume.
7. *Move on to the next section and repeat!*

Make sure that your GDoc is configured to be shared with "anyone with the link" and allow comments. In this way, the coach will be able to give you specific feedback if necessary. 

Your resume and professional profiles (LinkedIn and GitHub) have a similar structure and present the same information. **Keep a record of all the edits to your resume so that you can integrate them also into these profiles.**

### Submit your exercise

*Read [this FAQ](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234) for a reminder on how to submit your exercise.*

Now go to your Student Dashboard and **submit the link to your resume** for your coach to review and comment.

Remember to **submit the first version of your resume by Wednesday** to have time for the rounds of revision. You may require 3 reviews before gettingn approval!

Please note **you don't need to submit the worksheet.** It is intended to help you assess if your resume meets the requirements in the rubric.

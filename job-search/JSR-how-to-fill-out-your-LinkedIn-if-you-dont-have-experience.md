# Filling your LinkedIn profile without experience as a software developer

Getting your first job in any field is always very hard. How can you convince someone that you are a reliable professional if you’ve never had the chance to prove it? And how do you fill out your LinkedIn, particularly the “Experience” section, if you haven’t had any paid job as a software developer?

Our career coaches have prepared the following suggestions to help you fill out your LinkedIn profile:

1. Start with a **strong headline that highlights your skills and career interests**. For example, "Full-stack developer with skills in Java, Python, and Web Development.”

2. Focus on **your education and any relevant coursework or projects you've completed**. Highlight any relevant skills or technologies you've worked with during your studies.

3. In the Experience section, mention any **internships or personal projects** that demonstrate your skills and experience. Include **any coding project** you’ve worked on. If recruiters don't find any technical related entry, it's unlikely that they will consider you for the job.

If you want to read a summary of the ideas presented in the video, read the article [Tips for your experience section](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/options-for-filling-your-experience-section-in-Linkedin-without-software-dev-experience.md).

4. Finally, don’t include any Microverse experience unless you have been hired with a paid role. Nevertheless, you can mention that you have mentored other software devs as a volunteer in the Volunteering section. Check [neeraj bhardwaj’s Volunteering section](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neerajbhardwaj216/) for an example.

A word of caution: **Don’t copy the examples literally!** Recruiters usually find out; they may consider it unprofessional behavior and reject you. Always write your own personal entries.

# Intro to job search lesson - challenge yourself questions and answers

**1. What will your daily schedule look like while you search for a job?**

The same as when you were in the Core Program; you should plan on being available for the program time until you accept a job.

**2. What should you do if you get a job offer?**

Reach out to your career coach immediately and share all the context you have about the offer so they can help you make the right choice.

**3. What are things you should do every single day while job searching?**

Send job applications, build your professional network, and commit to at least one line of code. (Keep that GitHub green!)

# Step 2: Research the company and the industry

## Learning objectives

- Research a company before applying for a job.

### **Estimated time**: .45h

## Description

In this exercise you will look for information about the company you want to apply to and the industry it’s related to.

### Why should you do research before applying for a job?

Gathering information about the company to which you are applying to is useful for two purposes:

- To **identify essential information for “marketing” yourself**. Since companies receive large numbers of applications for a position, it’s essential to ensure that your application materials highlight why you are a good candidate for that specific role in that **particular company**. And to use that information to help you stand out. In Step 1, you analyzed the job, so you are familiar with the knowledge and skills required, and the responsibilities it entices. By researching the company’s mission, vision, current challenges, and culture, you will be able to:
    - Create a customized cover letter resume that tells a compelling story about you as a candidate for that role and write convincing arguments to support it.
    - Plan questions and comments for your interactions with different people in the recruitment process so that you can stand out as a professional who is interested in the company and has prepared for interviews.
- To **analyze whether the company is aligned with your interests and values**. Is it the right size for you? Do you share the company’s values? Do you care for the mission? Understanding the company will offer you insights into what your everyday life on the job will be like and how comfortable you may feel if you are hired.

### What should you look for and how?

When researching a company you can look into different types of information such as its mission, history and goals, financial data, staff and structure, location, culture, strengths and weaknesses, and growth prospects: current and future challenges. You can also gather data about the state and trades of the industry it belongs to. 

Another thing that you can look for in your research are keywords to use in your application materials. As you read information about the company, you can identify some key skills or personal attributes the company values in its employees and the words or phrases they use to describe them.

To do research about the information above you can look at sources that are published by the companies themselves or you can find out what others say about them. For example: 

- The job posting or job boards generally include an overview of the company.
- The company’s website and social networks offer insight into the organization.
- Business news and publications may give you important insights into what’s happening in a company.
- Industry surveys and reports analyze the sector and identify trends and challenges.

## Exercise

### Instructions

In this exercise you will follow 4 steps to research a company:

1. Write the questions you will research.
2. Study what the company says about itself.
3. Find out what others say about the company.
4. Review keywords and questions to ask during interviews.

And if you have the time also:

5. Research the industry.

### 2.1 Write the questions that you will research

When researching a company you can look into different types of information such as:

1. Mission, history, and goals. What’s the mission of the company? What are the main products and services? What’s their history?
2. Staff. How many employees does it have? Where are they from?
3. Structure.  How is the company organized? Who is the CEO? And other leaders? 
4. Location. Where does it operate? How many offices does it have? Is it remote?
5. Culture. What are the company’s values? Is team-oriented or individualistic? Competitive or nurturing? Inclusive? What do the people that work here look like? 
6. Financial data. How are the company’s finances? Is it profitable? How much does its operation cost? Reserves?
7. Strengths and weaknesses. What strengths do you see in the company? And weaknesses? Do you find anything that stands out about the company? 
8. Growth prospects. Is the company growing? In what direction?
9. Current and future challenges. What are the challenges the company is facing right now? Can you identify any future ones?

Of course you don’t have to cover all of the aspects. You can select those that you are most relevant to you and the role you are applying to. For example if you want to work in a small company and want to work independently, you can focus on the staff and structure of the company. 

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Select one of the companies that you have considered in your Job Application Tracking Sheet.
2. Reread the job posting and reflect upon the aspects that you want to know about.
3. Write out the list of questions you want to answer in the first column of Table B of this template.

### 2.2 Study what the company says about itself

Now it’s time to look for answers to your questions. The company’s website and social media are a good place to start. On the website check the description of its products or services as well as the sections that:
- Introduce the company such as: “About us,” “Who we are,” “Our team,” “Our history,” “Our mission,” “Our culture,”
- Present job opportunities in the company: “Careers” or “Work with us,”
- Provide information about the company’s current operation: “Facts,” “News,” and “Histories.”

Afterwards take a look at the company’s recent posts in social media (LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook) also. Review the headlines and scan any interesting article that you find. Remember to identify keywords that are used by the company for skills and attributes they value in its employees. For example a company's website may include statements such as "Creativity is our slogan and teamwork our commitment" that highlight two soft skills.

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Visit the company’s website and social media to look for information for the questions you registered in the step above.
2. Write answers that you find in the second column of Table B.
3. As you learn more about the company, you might find additional questions you want to answer as well as keywords. Register the former in Table C, and the latter in Table D.

### 2.3 Find out what others say about the company

Online reviews and news allow us to compare what the company says about itself with others. Look at what other employees say using job boards such as Glassdoor. Also study online reviews from client reviews. Are they positive or negative? Remember that you shouldn’t worry if there are one or two bad reviews, but that many of them can be a red flag. Do a Google search to find news and posts about the company. Remember to identify who is publishing the information to assess its reliability.

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Read employee and client reviews about the company to find out more about the company.
2. Do a Google search. Read through the headlines and scan any useful article to answer the questions you want to research.
3. Add any relevant findings for your questions in the second column B in Table B. 

### 2.4 Review keywords and questions to ask during interviews

Finally it’s important to study the information you have gathered with two purposes: 

1. Ensure you have registered all relevant keywords to customize your application materials.
2. Prepare the questions to ask during interviews.

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Identify any missing pieces of information in Table B.
2. Write questions that you can ask to your interviewers to find out the issues identified in Table C. Remember to have this table handy during interviews!

### Submit your exercise

*Read [this FAQ](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234) for a reminder on how to submit your exercise.*

Now go to your Student Dashboard and submit your exercise.

## Additional research

*This research is optional. It can be very useful once you are invited to interviews and move forward in the recruitment processes because it will offer you deeper information about that company in particular.* 

### Optional: Take a look into the industry 

Finding out about the industry in which a company operates can also be useful during the recruitment process. It will help you identify how the sector is performing, who the main competitors are, and the current challenges they face. So you will be able to talk about the challenges and opportunities of the company and thus show your ability to participate in strategic discussions.

Although there are many similarities in being a software developer for any organization, there are nuances between companies from different industries. Consider for example how different it will be working for an educational organization (i.e. a university, an edtech startup) or one from health services (i.e. a pharmaceutical, medical equipment, or medical insurance company), or retail (i.e. department stores, online stores, supermarkets). Some aspects such as daily activities and job responsibilities, salary, lifestyle, and professional development opportunities, among others, might vary from one industry to the other. This is relevant information for you to continue analyzing if the company is a good fit for you.

**Sussgeted steps to research an industry**

1. Identify the industry to which the company belongs.
2. Find information about the industry in surveys, overviews, or reports. 
3. Identify the main competitors in the sector and analyze how the company your are applying to is performing.

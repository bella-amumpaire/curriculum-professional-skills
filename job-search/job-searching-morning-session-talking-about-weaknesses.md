### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise

During this morning session, you will practice with one of your peers how to talk about your weaknesses in a job interview.

### Instructions

💡 **Remember that this meeting should take 1 hour, not 30 minutes.**

- Join the Zoom call with your team - remember to always be on time to respect your teammates’ time and practice respecting your interviewers’ time.
- Select a **leader** who will ensure you follow the outline below - do not skip any steps!


### Preparation - 15 min

1. In a big group, each will read the article [“Interview question: What is your greatest weakness?"](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-your-greatest-weakness-2061288) 
    - Mute your microphones and read in silence.


### Interview preparation - 10 min

1. Everybody will be an interviewer during the exercise, so each of you must follow the steps below:
    - List your weaknesses in section 1 of [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l4NG9NC0SQsJ5oTJHqcX__z8VcW6N3GDJRuGaMMUqJA/edit#) and select one for the interview.
    - Open your behavioral grid, and identify a story to use as context for speaking about your weakness. 
    - To plan your answer, use the SAR framework (situation - action - result) and fill in section 2 of the [worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l4NG9NC0SQsJ5oTJHqcX__z8VcW6N3GDJRuGaMMUqJA/edit#).    
    - Open the [following checklist for providing feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1izK9QCKhAJTp_tMyZ94hGGdZsJnGPnUqgPSImR1Baf0/edit?usp=sharing) and read the criteria and indicators that you will assess in the interview.

2. Split yourselves into groups of 2 and go into breakout rooms as you did [in this exercise](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/job-searching-morning-session-using-breakout-rooms-for-interview-practice.md#what-are-breakout-rooms).
    - **Set timer for breakout rooms - it should be 10 minutes.**
    - If there is an odd number of people in your group, one room will need to have 3 people.


### Quick interviews - 10 min

1. In your breakout rooms, you will take turns.
    - Each of you will play the role of an interviewer once and the role of an applicant once.

2. Take turns interviewing each other. The interviewer will ask the question: **What is your greatest weakness?**
    - The interviewer opens the [following checklist for giving advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1izK9QCKhAJTp_tMyZ94hGGdZsJnGPnUqgPSImR1Baf0/edit?usp=sharing). **You should fill it in during the interview if possible.*
    - The interviewer starts [timer](https://vclock.com/timer/#countdown=00:03:00&date=2022-06-24T17:11:04&sound=xylophone&loop=1).
    - **The applicant answers following the tips offered in the article.**
    - The interviewer indicates when the time is up.
    - The interviewer shares with the applicant the attribute(s) identified in the answer and explains why (if possible, give concrete examples). (1 min)

**Do not extend the allocated time as it is important that you practice completing tasks on time, as you will need to in your actual interviews.**

3. When you finish all interviews:
     - All interviewers complete the checklist.
     - All interviewers share a filled-in checklist with the applicant. **The applicant will use this for their exercise submission**.


### Recap with the big group - 10 min

1. Come back to the main room in Zoom.
2. Use [this Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrclyLFtL6b5fMdT) form for a self-assessment and rating for the interviewer.
3. Share something you will work on based on one piece of feedback with the entire group.

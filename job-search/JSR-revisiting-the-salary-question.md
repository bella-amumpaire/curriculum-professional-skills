## Learning objectives

- Evaluate a company and determine a baseline expected salary to ask for if needed.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5h

## Description

In this activity you will prepare an answer for the job position that you have decided to apply in the activity “Step 1: Find a job to apply for.”

### Why should you be prepared for the salary question?

As you go through the recruitment process, there are many chances that the recruiter or hiring manager will ask about your salary expectations. The most common mistake to avoid when answering this question is providing a very low or a very high number. Your challenge is to define a **realistic salary**, based on current salaries in similar positions and your financial needs. And some time to do research and analysis that you should invest beforehand.

### Steps to determine a good salary

Salaries are defined by a combination of factors such as the knowledge and skills of the professional, their experience, the location of the company, and the functions and responsibilities of the job. To figure out a realistic salary you will need to identify the salary range that is currently paid for a similar job to the one you are applying, then analyze the sum that will satisfy your financial needs within that range.

These are the steps to follow:

1. Read the job posting carefully and identify the:
   - Location
   - Knowledge and skills required
   - Experience
   - Functions and responsibilities
2. Find if the company has established a salary range for the position.
3. Do some research about current salaries for similar positions:
   - Set the regional filters
   - For remote companies, use the country where the company is located
   - Use tools such as [Glassdoor.com](http://Glassdoor.com), [Salary.com](https://www.salary.com/), [Clockify's Hourly Rate Calculator](https://clockify.me/hourly-rate-calculator), etc
4. Identify the lowest and the highest salaries paid currently to determine the range.
5. Analyze your financial needs and adjust the range you identified. For example, the lowest salary might not be enough for you, so increase it to meet your minimum acceptable income.

### Some important tips

- Write a phrase to present your salary expectations and practice reading it out loud to others. This is an example:
  _“Since I am new to the world of web development, I had to do some salary research and I am expecting something in the range of X to Y, depending on if the position is contract or permanent.”_
- If you feel uncomfortable and don’t want to answer the question, you can avoid it by making reference to other professional priorities such as:
  _“I am flexible because right now I'm focusing more on opportunities to learn and grow with solid mentorship.”
  “My current priority is finding a role and company that offers a culture that is the right fit for me.”
  “Through my research, I have discovered the average market salary is around X. Would you be willing to share with me if the pay range for this role matches the average?”_
- A recruiter may ask about your previous salary. Try to dodge it graciously so that it’s not used as a reference to define the salary they offer you. You can say something like:
  _“My previous experience was unrelated to web development and not aligned with my current skill set. As I move into my new career path, I expect a salary in the range of X to Y.”_

# Update and refine your GitHub profile

## **Learning objectives**

- Prepare a strong GitHub profile.

### **Estimated time: 2h**

## **Description**

Now, it’s time to focus on your GitHub profile and submit it to your coach for review. For software developers, this profile is particularly relevant. 

Remember that your GitHub profile **must be approved** to complete the block successfully and you have:

- **Two rounds of reviews**, so study the coach’s comments carefully and integrate any changes required before resubmitting.
- **Two weeks** to get your profile approved. 

❗️ Submit your first version **no later than Wednesday of the week it's due** to have time to go through the necessary rounds of revision.

Coaches might take up to 3 days to review your work and send their comments.


## Why is a GitHub profile important?

Your GitHub profile will be used during the recruitment process, recruiters will use GitHub to:

1. Assess **your coding skills**. Since GitHub hosts repositories with your code, it is the primary resource employers will refer to find out what you can do.
2. Find out **who you are**. Your profile includes a short bio and a personal README that will let recruiters and other stakeholders learn more about you.
3. Check on **your coding activity**. GitHub also provides evidence of  how frequently you code. So keeping it green shows you are committed to coding.
4. Learn about **your participation in the software community**. GitHub is not only a repository for your code but also a place where you interact with other software developers. Your projects' stars are indicators of your interaction with other coders.

Read the article [4 reasons to start or update your GitHub profile](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/magazine/4-reasons-to-start-or-update-your-github-profile) if you have any questions about why this profile is essential.

## Attributes and an example of a good GitHub profile 

A compelling profile provides information for the purposes above in your short bio, personal README, and the repositories for the different projects you have coded. The [GitHub rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bKRDHlZMUc9xIQrktnoRMs8Z6e3k_fdeFipr1IT1cWw/edit#) that you will use in this activity, provides a detailed list of attributes. Yet, nothing like a realy example to show !, but now, take a look at and excellent example. It belongs to a Micronaut whose profile helped him get an amazing job.

# Ruby on Rails - Recommended Resources

As a full-stack web developer you should have a clear understanding of Ruby on Rails, as it's a proven way to build robust back-end applications.

## Key elements to answer Ruby on Rails questions

Your answer to these questions should be based on a deep understanding of how the Ruby language works: the core concepts, as well as how to implement common features. It should also show your practical knowledge of working with the Rails framework, by including an understanding of its architecture and basic features.

Additionally, you should:

- Get a good understanding of the question, by asking **clarifying** questions
- Give a **clear definition** of the concept
- Provide an **example** of the concept in action
- Share your \*_opinion_ about the concept (i.e trade-offs, personal experience)

Knowing what to do is important, but so is knowing what NOT to do. Learn more about the common issues you should prevent:

## Competencies to focus on

Besides looking at techniques to answer the technical questions well, there are related competencies that could help you answer this question:

- Technical Knowledge
- Communication

Below you'll find various resources that will help you improve.

### Competency: Technical Knowledge

A competent Ruby on Rails developer is able to develop and test web applications using Rails and the ERB templating language. They should also be able to work with the RubyGems package manager and know how to deliver fully-functional APIs.

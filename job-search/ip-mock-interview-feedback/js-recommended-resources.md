# JavaScript - Recommended Resources

As a full-stack web developer, you should have a solid understanding of JavaScript, as it is essential to building front-end applications.

## Key elements to answer JavaScript questions

Your answer to these questions should be based on a deep understanding of how the JavaScript language works: the core concepts, as well as how to implement common features.

Additionally, you should:

- Get a good understanding of the question, by asking **clarifying** questions
- Give a **clear definition** of the concept
- Provide an **example** of the concept in action
- Share your \*_opinion_ about the concept (i.e trade-offs, personal experience)

Knowing what to do is important, but so is knowing what NOT to do. Learn more about the common issues you should prevent:

## Competencies to focus on

Besides looking at techniques to answer the technical questions well, there are related competencies that could help you answer this question:

- Technical Knowledge
- Communication

Below you'll find various resources that will help you improve.

### Competency: Technical Knowledge

A competent JavaScript developer is able to build front-end web applications using ES6 syntax, working with APIs and manipulating the DOM.

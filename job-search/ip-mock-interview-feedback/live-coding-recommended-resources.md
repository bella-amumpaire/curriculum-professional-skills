# Live Coding Challenges - Recommended Resources

Live coding challenges are used to **assess a potential software engineer candidate's competencies** by presenting them with programming problems.

## Key elements to answer the live coding challenge

Your answer to this section revolves around **your approach to the coding challenge**. You should show an effort to understand the problem in the coding challenge, plan out a solution and proceed to narrate your work process.

In other words, you should:

- Confirm your **understanding of the challenge** before starting to code
- Ask **clarifying questions** if needed to understand the challenge
- Make a **plan** before you start writing code
- Share your **thought process** as they write code
- Use **Google** if necessary in an autonomous way

Knowing what to do is important, but so is knowing what NOT to do. Learn more about the common issues you should prevent:

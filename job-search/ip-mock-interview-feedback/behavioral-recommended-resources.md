# Behavioral Skills - Recommended Resources

Behavioral questions are meant to evaluate **how a candidate has displayed behaviors in the past that are in line with company values**. This is done by:

- Asking questions about your work history or personal situations
- Providing you (fictional) scenarios to learn how you respond to various situations

## Key elements to answer the behavioral questions

Your answer to these type of questions should describe how you behaved in a specific situation from the past. You should highlight a personal attribute or professional skill related to the question and explain your actions. Finally, explain both the results of your actions and lessons learned for the future.

Additionally, you should:

1. Offer **evidence of at least one of the attributes** the question explores (see specific attribute per type of question in the toggle below).
2. Provide an answer with the elements of the **SAR (Situation - Action - Result)** or **CARL (Content - Action - Result - Learning)** framework:
   1. Presenting the specific situation, stating explicitly where it happened in your role,
   2. Describing your actions to solve the problem (using the pronoun I, so that it’s clear what you did),
   3. Discussing the outcomes of your actions,
   4. Analyzing how the lessons learned have made you a better software developer.
3. Present the story **engagingly and interestingly**.

Knowing what to do is important, but so is knowing what NOT to do. Learn more about the common issues you should prevent:

## Competencies to focus on

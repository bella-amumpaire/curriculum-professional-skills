# Behavioral Skills - Recommended Resources

Behavioral questions are meant to evaluate **how a candidate has displayed behaviors in the past that are in line with company values**. This is done by:

- Asking questions about your work history or personal situations
- Providing you (fictional) scenarios to learn how you respond to various situations

## Key elements to answer the behavioral questions

Your answer to these type of questions should describe how you behaved in a specific situation from the past. You should highlight a personal attribute or professional skill related to the question and explain your actions. Finally, explain both the results of your actions and lessons learned for the future.

Additionally, you should:

1. Offer **evidence of at least one of the attributes** the question explores (see specific attribute per type of question in the toggle below).
2. Provide an answer with the elements of the **SAR (Situation - Action - Result)** or **CARL (Content - Action - Result - Learning)** framework:
   1. Presenting the specific situation, stating explicitly where it happened in your role,
   2. Describing your actions to solve the problem (using the pronoun I, so that itâ€™s clear what you did),
   3. Discussing the outcomes of your actions,
   4. Analyzing how the lessons learned have made you a better software developer.
3. Present the story **engagingly and interestingly**.

Knowing what to do is important, but so is knowing what NOT to do. Learn more about the common issues you should prevent:

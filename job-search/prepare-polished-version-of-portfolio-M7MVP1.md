# Prepare a polished version of your portfolio to start job searching

## **Learning objectives**

- Improve your personal portfolio site.
- Add a new project to your portfolio.

### **Estimated time: 4h**

## **Description**

In this activity, you will make your portfolio website **more unique** and update your showcased projects in order to ensure it compellingly represents your skills and is ready share with recruiters.

After you’ve upgraded your website, you will then submit it to a career coach for review. Your coach will send you feedback and request changes if necessary.

- **Three rounds of reviews**
  - You have a maximum of **three rounds of reviews** to get your portfolio approved, so study the coach’s comments carefully and integrate any changes required.
- **Two weeks to completion**
  - This is a carry-over activity so you will have **two weeks to complete it**. We recommend you submit your first version by the Saturday of the first week to have time to go through the necessary rounds of revision.

## Refresher on what makes a good portfolio

Your portfolio website serves 2 purposes:

1. **Convince employers**
   - Employers want skilled developers. A portfolio website proves that you have the skills it takes to do the job.
2. **Differentiate yourself**
   - The labor market is a competition. With your unique portfolio website you can show potential employers who you are and why they should work with you (and not others).

As you have learned, portfolios come in all sorts of shapes and colors, but solid and compelling ones share four attributes:

- They are **simple**: there’s no extraneous information, only basic background information, contact information, and a project showcase.
- They are **visual**: they use screenshots, mockups, live demos, and other visual tools to show the viewer what you’re capable of making.
- They are **thorough**: while the design itself may be simple, they make use of links (both in-text and otherwise) to show extra background information about the work, projects, and history.
- And they **look good**: they use 1-3 elegant fonts, focus on 2-4 different colors, use high quality images, and use color palettes that are attractive and harmonious.

## Project setup

- Open up the **latest version** of your portfolio website.
- Open the [Assess your portfolio rubric and worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QCI3eNjdXghP_ZjNVmUZq0DO9hKovbbRp2FsAWdVVuU/).

## **Exercise**

### **Instructions**

Analyze and score your portfolio website. You will take a look at **6 types of requirements**:

- Design
- Content
- Interactivity
- Device support
- Language
- Proje
You are probably thinking that these are many steps. But you would be surprised at how much a well-polished portfolio will impact your job opportunities!

For each section you need to:

1. **Read** the requirements carefully.
2. **Compare** each requirement with your portfolio website.
3. **Identify** if your portfolio meets each requirement.
4. **Add** your assessment in the “Score and areas of improvement” (see example in the rubric). Include any possible areas of improvement.
5. Make **use** of the suggested resources (or any other ones within the Microverse curriculum).
6. **Improve** your portfolio website.
7. _Move on to the next section and repeat!_

After the scoring you should **make improvements** to your project, until you believe it satisfies all requirements.

When finished, (1) add a demo link and (2) comments in the worksheet before you **submit it to your coach** for review.

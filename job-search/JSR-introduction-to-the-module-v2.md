# Introduction to the module

### **Estimated time**: .25h

## Welcome to the Professional Skills Capstone!

Congratulations on successfully completing the technical component of Microverse’s Core Program. In this last module, you will work on getting ready for job searching. We know you are anxious to get a job as soon as possible, but the best way to succeed is to take some time to prepare yourself before sending job applications. Knowing how to code is critical, but not enough! You also need to “sell” yourself through your application materials and in interviews. So, as the saying goes: “Slow and steady wins the race!”

### Why is this module important for you?

First things first! Watch this video when Autumn Huffman explains why it’s worthwhile to invest your time in preparing yourself for job search now.

### What will you work on in this module?

After some introductory lessons about the recruitment process in general, you will complete four kinds of learning activities:

- An exercise to create your "skills grid", designed to help you identify your top skills and attributes, those in which you excel. The first step to “sell” yourself as a software developer is to understand what you have to offer to a company.
- Lessons and exercises to hone your interviewing skills:
    - In morning sessions, you will continue practicing the strategies to deal with the common issues that you face in technical with your peers. This second look at them, will strengthen your knowledge and master them.
    - Every day, you will also have a more extended interview practice where you will work on specific interview skills: answering technical & behavioral questions, talking about your projects, and live coding. In some live coding sessions, you will apply the algorithms and data structures that are commonly considered in it. 
    - You will refresh your knowledge about the specific types of interviews and how to prepare for them. 
    - You will learn about CARL, an alternate format to SAR. 
    - You will create 2 behavioral grid stories with CARL and submit them for review and approval. 
    - Finally, you will also attend an interview with an industry professional interviewer who will assess you. Successful performance in this interview is a requirement to complete the block 3 in the module.
- Five projects where you will refine your application materials and send them to career coaches for review and approval:
    - You will work on your LinkedIn and GitHub profile to present a strong picture of you, as a software developer.
    - You will revise your resume and your cover letter to ensure they tell a personalized story. 
    - You will revamp your portfolio and include all your projects.
- A step-by-step walkthrough to submit a job application. We will guide you all the way, from finding a job posting to submitting the job application.


### Do you need to keep coding while you refine your application materials?

Yes! Even though you won't be working on coding projects, it's very important that you **code and make commits to your GitHub every day to keep your activity green**. A green GitHub is an attribute that shows recruiters your passion for and dedication to programming. A grey one can be misinterpreted by recruiters as a signal that you haven't been coding for a while. 

You don't need to work on complex project. A useful strategy to maintain GitHub activity while you're busy working on something else is to work on one of your side projects very slowly. For instance, you could update a Ruby gem dependency on one of your projects, or do some minor code cleanup to improve formatting to generate commits. You can also generate GitHub activity simply by opening issues against one of your projects. For example, if you want a green dot on your profile today, you could find one of your projects that doesn't have any automated tests, then open an issue that says ‘Write tests for this project.’ Check [this video](https://www.loom.com/share/97f5fba2a94445cd8f6eaac70cc987ef) for more suggestions. 


### How will you be assessed?

- A career coach will review your behavioral grid and application materials, and approve them if they meet all the requirements in the corresponding rubric. You will have a maximum of 2 or 3 reviews to get your submission approved, depending on the project. If necessary, you can use your extra reviews to improve your materials further and get them approved.
- The industry professional mock interviewer will assess and rate your performance in the mock interview using a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 means you need to improve substantially to be prepared for job interviews and 4, that you are very well prepared. To successfully complete the interview, you will need a score of 3 or 4. If you get a score of 1 or 2, you will repeat the block so that you can hone your interview skills and schedule another interview.

❗️ On the "Professional Skills Feedback" page on your Student Dashboard, you will be able to check your scores for the different types of questions and recommended resources you can study to improve.


### A final note about workload

We know you are probably exhausted from the technical modules and the Final Capstone. This module has lighter workload to help you catch up your energies as you prepare for job searching.

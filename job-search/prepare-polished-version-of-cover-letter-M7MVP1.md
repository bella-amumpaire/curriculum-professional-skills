# Prepare a polished version of your cover letter to start the revision process

## **Learning objectives**

- Write a clear, compelling cover letter.

### **Estimated time: 2h**

## **Description**

In this exercise, you will write a cover letter that explains why you are a good candidate for a job posting and provides convincing arguments to sustain this claim. You will submit this polished cover letter to your career coach as a starting point for the in-depth revision that you will perform during the week.

## **Refresh your memory about what makes a strong cover letter**

Compelling cover letters **tell a story** about you, your knowledge, skills, and previous experience, in the context of a specific job posting and a particular company. Before crafting your cover letter, review this lesson to make sure you understand the attributes of a strong cover letter and how it differs from weak ones:

Work through the following steps to prepare a customized cover letter for a job application that you plan to send this week. As in the case of the resume, it’s important to read through your cover letter several times with different intentions.

1. Select a job posting that you are interested in applying for this week. If you haven’t chosen one already, you can refer to the resource [“Where do I find jobs to apply to?](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/where-do-I-find-jobs-to-apply-to.md) for ideas on where to look.

2. Read the job posting carefully and spend 10 - 15 minutes doing some research about the company. Find at least 2 -3 reasons why you would want that job. Identify the company's mission and value statements. How do they relate to your skills, personal attributes and professional experience?

3. Open one of the cover letters that you have written and make a copy so that you can edit it for the new job posting.

4. Read through the letter to analyze how the story that you are telling works. What changes are necessary to align it with the job posting that you want to apply for now? Are you communicating why you are fit for that specific job? Make any necessary edits in the different paragraphs to provide compelling arguments.

5. Look at the format of your cover letter: margins, line spacing, and fonts. Is it attractive and consistent? Make any necessary changes.

6. Now, review the different elements in your cover letter. Using [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eW0IbKPn6MN47EMSZ35HPQMsaOuX2e7MdBu-LUb1C44/edit), analyze if your cover letter meets each and every one of the requirements of the rubric. If necessary, refer to the learning resources in our job searching curriculum for instructions on how to write each section. Make any additional edits that are required.

7. Do a final check of the grammar and spelling of your cover letter. Run it through Grammarly.

8. Read your cover letter one more time to look for any detail that you might have missed.

Your cover letter is now ready for your career coach to review!

Now go to your Student Dashboard and **submit the link to your cover letter for your coach to review.**

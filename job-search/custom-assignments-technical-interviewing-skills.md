## Introduction

This personalized plan will guide you through the tasks you can work on this month to strengthen your technical interviewing skills. It is the specific job searching area your career coach recommends you to focus on considering your personal needs and achievements.

### Why is it important to work on your technical interviewing skills?

Nearly every company relies on some common types of interview formats, questions and take-home assignments, so preparing in advance for those common types of interviews will give you a much better chance of acing that interview and landing the job. This plan will also help you understand what to expect when a recruiter or hiring manager reaches out to you. 

Microverse career coaches have prepared this plan to help you continue to build strong technical interviewing skills and put them into practice immediately.

# Time booked for coding or working on application materials

### Estimated time: 1h

## **Description**

Use this time to continue coding so that your GitHub is green and to refine your portfolio or your application materials until career coaches approve them.

### How should you use the time booked for making project changes?

As in other projects, we give you flexibility. Remember you have two goals:

- Get your portfolio and all application materials approved by the established deadline.
- Make small commits every day to your repositories to keep your GitHub profile green.

### What should you do if you need more time for making changes to your application materials?

The time booked for the project changes is an estimate, so it is ok if it occasionally takes you longer to complete a project. Refining your application materials might feel like a burden sometimes. Yet, remember that compelling application materials and a strong portfolio are essential to get invited to an interview!

### How can you keep your GitHub profile green if you have very little time?

You don't need to work on complex project. You can do small improvements to your portfolio or any of your projects. For instance:

- You can update a Ruby gem dependency on one of your projects, or do some minor code cleanup to improve formatting to generate commits.
- You can also generate GitHub activity simply by opening issues against one of your projects. For example, if you want a green dot on your profile today, you could find one of your projects that doesn't have any automated tests, then open an issue that says ‘Write tests for this project.’

# Submit one of your application materials for review - Optional

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Introduction

Today you can submit one of your application materials for review. This submission is optional for job searchers that need to make some changes to an application material before continuing to apply to jobs.

❗️ **Note: This week coaches will not review application materials submitted through the Dashboard.** 

Please contact your coach if you need them to review one of your documents.

### Why is submitting one of your application materials for review important?

Because feedback is a gift! Sharing your application material with your career coach is a great way to get some constructive feedback on the work you've done. This will allow you to make sure your material is compelling to recruiters and hiring managers and to amend accordingly if necessary.

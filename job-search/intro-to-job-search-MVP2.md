## Learning objectives

- Understand what to expect from job searching with Microverse.

### Estimated time: 1hr

## Description

Congratulations for finishing the Core Program! In this lesson, we will go over what you should expect from the next part of Microverse: job searching.

### Why is job searching important?

Now that you've finished the core Microverse program where you've learned the basic skills needed to be a successful full-stack web developer, it's time to focus on putting those skills to work to land your next job. Job searching can be a difficult process, but Microverse is here to help ensure you have the tools and structure that you need to succeed.

### What makes a successful job search?

Job searching can be a long process with a lot of rejection along the way. There are a lot of unknown factors: which jobs will be available on the market? Are hiring managers looking for candidates with your profile? Are your interviewers in a good mood the day they interview you? All of these things will affect your job search, but they are outside your control. So instead of worrying about them, we will focus entirely on the things are you _can_ control.

# How to use correct technical terminology in application materials

To show your expertise effectively, apply the following guidelines whenever working on your application materials:

### Categorize your skills correctly

As a professional developer, you want to categorize your skills in a way that shows the **accuracy of your technical understanding**.

An example of ✅ *good* categorization is the following:

| Category                           | Technology                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Programming Languages              | Java, Python, C++, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP |
| Libraries & Frameworks             | React, Rails, jQuery, Django, Express.js |
| Web Development                    | HTML5, CSS3                              |
| Database Management                | SQL, Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL  |
| Operating Systems                  | Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS              |
| Version Control                    | Git, SVN                                 |
| Software Development Methodologies | Agile, Waterfall                         |
| Developer tools                    | GitHub, Slack                            |

A ❌ *bad* example (which can be found in many job postings) would be **grouping everything**, with the risk of misrepresenting your skillset and expertise.

| Category         | Technology                                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Technical skills | JavaScript, React, Git, GitHub, Rails, Windows, SQL, Agile |

### Use capital letters appropriately

Certain tools or technologies are written in a certain way. Make sure you _follow the convention_! However, if there isn’t any specified way of writing a particular term you should **default to title casing**: “This Is When Every Word Starts With A Capitalization!”

Below are a few conventions worth keeping in mind:

| ❌ Incorrect                      | ✅ Correct    |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Html5, html5                      | HTML5         |
| Css, css, css3, Css3              | CSS3          |
| Ror, RoR                          | Ruby on Rails |
| javascript, js, Javascript        | JavaScript    |
| git, GIT                          | Git           |
| Github, github                    | GitHub        |
| Full Stack, fullstack, full-stack | Full-stack    |
| Front end, frontend, front-end    | Front-end     |
| Back end, backend, back-end       | Back-end      |

### Pay attention to details

If your resume contains _errors_, _typos_, or _inconsistencies_, it can create a negative impression of you and potentially disqualify you from consideration for the position.

Attention to detail demonstrates to potential employers that you are diligent, thorough, and committed to producing high-quality work.

We recommend that you use a tool like [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) to resolve these types of issues.

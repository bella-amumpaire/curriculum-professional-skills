# Job Searching - Submit 1-2 job applications

### **Estimated time**: 2h

## Introduction

You will be submitting 1 to 2 job applications on a daily basis during your job search.

In order to assist you and keep you going, we've regrouped below some of the different places you can look for jobs online.

### Why is submitting job applications important?

Job searching is more of a marathon than a sprint race. In this regard, regularity and consistency are key to ensure job opportunities come your way. Keeping the pace is also essential. Running too fast will burn you, too slow will take a very long time to get to the finish line.

By sending one or two applications every day, while making sure that your application materials showcase the skills and attributes that make you an excellent candidate **for the particular role and company that you are applying for**, you will increase your chances of getting job interviews and finding your dream job. So the quality of your applications is as important as the quantity.

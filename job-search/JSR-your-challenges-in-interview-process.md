# Your challenges in the interview process

## Learning objectives

- Learn about common issues that occur during technical job interviews.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5h

## Description

In this exercise, you will reflect upon the challenges the different steps in the interview process will present for you, and you will identify how to better prepare for them.

## Why is it important to think about your interview challenges now?

Since the recruitment process is a funnel, to get a job, you will need to succeed in all the steps in the interview process. Each type of interview demands from you a different skillset, so you need to combine different strategies to prepare yourself. In this module, we will help you practice all of them. By identifying the aspects that seem more challenging for you, you can target your efforts to overcome them. Also, during the interview practice, you will be able to get feedback from peers and from an industry professional mock interviewer and analyze whether your insecurity is related to imposter syndrome or if you need to hone some skills.

As you do so, think about these questions:

- Who you will interact with at each step (the recruiter, the hiring manager, members of the team or other stakeholders, leaders)
- What kind of questions will be asked, or what tasks will you be required to perform?
- Have you participated in each kind of interview?
- How difficult do you think a stage will be for you? What challenges do you expect to face? Consider both the technical skills and interpersonal abilities it involves, as well as your personal attributes. Maybe you are shy, get very nervous pair-programming, feel insecure about your English, or hate talking about yourself.

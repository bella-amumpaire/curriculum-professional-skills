# Interview practice: phone screen

## Learning objectives

- Successfully complete a phone screen, a common first step in an interview process.

### **Estimated time**: 2h

## Description

```
❗️❗️❗️IMPORTANT NOTE:
In order to make the most out of this exercise you need to find a partner
who will play the role of your interviewer (in exchange you will do the same for them).
If you have a learning partner(s) assigned this is the way to go!

Otherwise, we recommend looking for a partner in your Morning session group
but you can contact anybody else from your cohort.
```

In today’s practice session you will refresh your knowledge about phone screens — also called recruiters’ interviews — and participate in another mock phone screen with your partner to prepare yourself for this kind of interview. 

### Why is it important to practice phone screens?

After filtering candidates based on their application materials, most companies perform a phone screen where a recruiter interviews candidates to verify that they are interested in the job and are good candidates for the position because they have mastered the necessary knowledge and skills. This first interview is used as a second filter before moving applicants to a technical interview or take-home exam that demands more time from the recruiting team. Preparing yourself to answer common phone screen questions will help you answer them confidently and give a positive impression to your interviewer.

## Exercise

### Instructions

During this session you will spend between 1 and 1.5 hours in a Zoom call with your partner where you will both play the role of interviewer and applicant on a phone screen. Before joining the Zoom call with your learning partner, take some time to review the resources about phone screens.

### 1. Preparation

Spend 15-20 minutes refreshing your knowledge about phone screens. How much do you remember about these types of interviews? Answer these questions on a piece of paper to test yourself:

1. How long do phone screens last?
2. What do interviewers assess in phone screens?
3. What are some of the common questions included in phone interviews?
4. How should you answer questions about your previous jobs or positions?
5. How should you answer questions about your skills?
6. What are the five key aspects of phone screen etiquette that you should follow?
7. How can you prepare for a phone screen?

To self-assess your answers, find the information that responds to each question in the following articles:

- [What should I expect during a phone screen?](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058150254-What-Should-I-Expect-During-Phone-Screens-)
- [What should I know about phone screen etiquette?](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059984953-What-Should-I-Know-About-Phone-Screen-Etiquette-)
- [How do I prepare for a phone screen interview?](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052321073-How-do-I-prepare-for-a-phone-screen-interview-)

Spend another 5 minutes studying your resume to prepare yourself to answer questions about your work experiences in the mock phone screen.

### 2. During the call

In today’s session you will perform a mock phone screen of each other that will take between 20-30 minutes, depending on the length of your answers. The exercise consists of three phases: interview setup, mock interview, and feedback.

### Interview set up - 10 min

Since both of you will play the role of interviewer and applicant, both of you follow these steps:

1. Share your resume with each other.
2. Read your partner’s resume and analyze their previous experiences, knowledge, and skills carefully.
3. Open the [Mock phone screen template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_PCjAmWZolDkHywqawTqgbzuryCuEKjluEpKTSMs3vQ/edit#), and: 
    1. Write your partner’s name and the date.
    2. Select the 10 questions you will ask your partner from the list that appears in Section 2 and write them in Table A.
    3. Study the aspects you will assess in each other's performance in Table B carefully. 
4. Open the [timer](https://vclock.com/timer/#countdown=00:03:00&date=2022-06-24T17:11:04&sound=xylophone&loop=1) and verify it’s set up to 3 min.

### Mock Phone Screen - between 20 to 30 min each

1. Decide who will play the role of the interviewer first.
2. The interviewer makes the sound of a ringtone to simulate a real phone call and the applicant answers as they would on a phone screen.
3. The interviewer asks permission to record the interview and starts recording.
4. The interviewer follows the interview template in Section 2 and asks the 10 questions selected using the timer to keep track of the time used to answer each question. 
5. Once the applicant answers, the interviewer registers the time in the template.

### Feedback - 10 min each

1. When the phone screen finishes, the interviewer assesses the applicant's performance and fills in Table B. If possible the interviewer shares the screen so the applicant can follow as they write.
2. The applicant asks any questions about their performance and the interviewer clarifies as necessary.
3. The interviewer shares the filled-in checklist with the applicant.
4. Now change roles and perform the second mock phone screen.

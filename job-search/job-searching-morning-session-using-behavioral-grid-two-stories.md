# Peer-to-peer interview practice: Using the behavioral grid to answer interview questions (2)

## Learning objectives

- Answer common behavioral questions in the SAR format.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise

The behavioral grid is a very useful tool to help you answer behavioral interview questions. During this morning session, you will practice with one of your peers **how to use different projects or experiences in your behavioral grid** to answer the same question.

### Instructions

üí° **Remember that this meeting should take 1 hour, not 30 minutes.**

- Join the Zoom call with your team - remember to always be on time to respect your teammates‚Äô time and practice respecting your interviewers‚Äô time.
- Select a **leader** who will ensure you follow the outline below - do not skip any steps!

### Preparation - 10 min

1. Watch the following video to understand how you will use the behavioral video.

2. As a big group, ensure that all of you understand what you will doing, and that are familiar with the behavioral grid and the SAR framework. If necessary, refer to this lesson:

- [Create your behavioral grid](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/create-your-behavioral-grid.md)

### Interviewers setup - 5 min

1. Everybody will play the role of an interviewer, so each of you must:

   - Open [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pJ8BIhi39iYl6k498xqdAR_TfZhotunao2CTqF6L6Rs/edit#gid=2041017957) and get a list of randomly generated behavioral questions.
   - Read the list of questions and select **one question** to ask your partner about a past situation (with the format ‚ÄúTell me about‚Äù).
   - Reflect upon the attribute that each question will help you identify in the applicant, such as initiative, empathy, compassion, humility, and teamwork.
   - Open the [following checklist for providing feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-qHNXwhKKc5TeXAtYYZwkHwr5xGkSk2pyzxlbtsp5_I/edit?usp=sharing). Copy the question that you will be asking in section 2 and register the attribute that it will help you identify.
   - Read the criteria and indicators you will assess in the interview.

2. Split yourselves into groups of 2 and go into breakout rooms as you did [in this exercise](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/job-searching-morning-session-using-breakout-rooms-for-interview-practice.md#what-are-breakout-rooms).
   - **Set timer for breakout rooms - it should be 35 minutes.**
   - If there is an odd number of people in your group, one room will need to have 3 people.

### Collaborative preparation for interviews and quick interviews - 35 min

1. Begin by telling each other the question that you will ask and discuss the attribute that it explores.

2. Individually, spend 10 minutes preparing two different answers for that same question using your behavioral grid as a reference. Follow these steps:

   - Open your behavioral grid and read quickly the different projects you have registered and the stories you have written using them.
   - Select 2 projects or experiences that you can use to answer the question you will be asked.
   - Write an answer to the question with those 2 projects, considering the three elements of the SAR structure for each and identify keywords that will help you remember the main ideas. You can use [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1skX7M4uT-lHmMFLxrvivlhzTv4hANfW8zZQzAoqdAG8/edit) to write your answers.

3. Take turns doing the interviews. In each one, follow these steps:

   - The interviewer opens the [following checklist for giving advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-qHNXwhKKc5TeXAtYYZwkHwr5xGkSk2pyzxlbtsp5_I/edit?usp=sharing). **You should fill it in during the interview if possible.**
   - The interviewer starts [timer](https://vclock.com/timer/#countdown=00:03:00&date=2022-06-24T17:11:04&sound=xylophone&loop=1).
   - The interviewer asks the question a first time.
   - The applicant answers using one of the projects/experience from the behavioral grid.
   - The interviewer indicates when the time is up.
   - The interviewer asks the question a second time. Remember that it will be the same one on both occasions.
   - The applicant answers using another project/experience from the behavioral grid.
   - The interviewer offers feedback to the applicant, describing how the two answers were different and which one provided stronger evidence of the attribute to be explored, and explaining why it did or did not (if possible, give concrete examples). (1 min)
   - The applicant reflects how comfortable they felt with each answer.

   **The applicant answers the same question twice, with two distinct answers that use a different project or experience as context.**

**Do not extend the allocated time as it is important that you practice completing tasks on time, as you will need to in your actual interviews.**

4. When you finish all interviews:
   - All interviewers complete the checklist.
   - All interviewers share a filled-in checklist with the applicant. **The applicant will use this for their exercise submission**.

### Recap with the big group - 10 min

1. Come back to the main room in Zoom.
2. Use [this Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrclyLFtL6b5fMdT) form for a self-assessment and rating for the interviewer.
3. Share something you will work on based on one piece of feedback with the entire group.

### Estimated time: .25hr

## Description

Welcome to advanced job searching at Microverse! In this lesson, we will go over what you should expect from this module and what we expect from you. 

### Why is this module important to you?

After 2 months job searching, you are very familiar with the key activities that will get you a job. Yet, keeping your spirits up can be challenging, because the process may be taking longer than you thought. Also, it can be discouraging to face a lot of rejection --and even worse, ghosting-- along the way. 

This module is the last one in the Microverse curriculum and it is repeatable, that is, you will re-enroll in it as many times as necessary. It is designed to support you by:
- Reminding you the essential tasks that you need to focus on and sharing with you links to information about how to perform them,
- Offering you opportunities to practice your interview and coding skills, in skippable morning sessions,
- Letting you to request personalized feedback from your coach about your job search goals and analysis, or your application materials,
- Giving you access to a coaching events to deepen your mastery of job searching topics and skills.

### How is this module structured?

The daily schedule includes the critical tasks for job searching. The activities are repetitive, but that's unavoidable! We present them as a roadmap to help you work consistently on your job search. All activities are skippable, except the Weekly retrospective, and you can skip an unlimited number in each block.

Please note there are no daily standups and you won't have a learning partner in this module. Yet, you are assigned a morning session group for you to collaborate with your peers. Do get in touch with them! You can practice interview skills, get together for pair-programming, or work on a collaborative coding project. It's your choice! 

Remember that proactive communication is essential for collaboration: we highly recommend you reach out to your morning session peers at the begining of the week. Inform them if you will attend the morning sessions and let them know if and how you want to collaborate.

### What do we expect of you?

To help you, our career coaches need to know how you are job searching, your achievements, and your blockers. So, to maintain your status as an enrolled job searcher, we require you to complete the weekly retrospective every week.

### How will career coaches support you?

Your career coach will review the assignments you decide to submit and give you feedback:
- Your job searching SMART goals,
- Your analysis of your job search, or
- An application material.

Also, you can reach out to your career coach through Zendesk for specific questions about your job search and, if necessary, request a 1:1 meeting. And don't forget that you can register to coaching events to hone your job searching skills further!

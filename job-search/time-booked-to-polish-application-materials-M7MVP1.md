# Time booked to polish and update your application material


### Estimated time: 1h


## **Description**

Continue working on the application material that you and your coach are reviewing this week. After you make all the edits that your coach suggests, ask for a new review. You and your coach can use Gdoc comments or Zendesk messages to communicate during these rounds of revision. 

Your coach will let you know when your application material is ready in a Zendesk message. Once that happens, you should submit the final version in a separate exercise that appears for that purpose in your Student Dashboard.

**Remember that the whole revision process of your application materials might require several rounds.** You will probably work between 8 and 16 hours throughout the week on this project. 

### How should you use the time booked for making project changes?

As in other projects, we give you flexibility. Use the time that best fits your schedule and that lets you get an approved version of your application material by the end of the week. As a reference to the steps you and your coach will go through, refer to the intro to these projects in the lesson:

- [Project introduction: Review your application materials to boost your job searching](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/intro-review-your-application-materials-M7MVP1.md)

### What should you do if you need more time for project changes than the amount booked?

The time booked for the project changes is an estimate, so it is ok if it occasionally takes you longer to complete a project. This submission of the final version of your application material is a carry-over activity. If you are not able to get your application approved by the deadline, you will be given one more week to complete it without having to repeat the block.

**Remember that the goal is to make sure that your application material is ready to successfully help you get an amazing job.**

### Should I make a submission now?
No. You will only submit the final version, once it is approved by your coach, as a separate exercise in your Dashboard.

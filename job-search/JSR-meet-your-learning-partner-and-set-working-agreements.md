# Meet your learning partner(s) and set working agreements

## Learning objectives

- Recognize the importance of investing in good working relationships with teammates.
- Understand how to make working agreements with new teammates.

### **Estimated time**: .5h

## Description

In this activity, you will meet with your partner to connect with each other and establish working agreements for interview practice during the week. 

*If you have a learning partner(s) assigned this is the way to go! Othwerwise, we recommend looking for a partner in your Morning session group but you can contact anybody else from your cohort.*


The interview practice in this module consists of 2 hours sesions in which you will complete structured exercises that target different kind of interviews, and you will give each other feedback on your performance using a checklist. 

### Begin with an icebreaker

When you are practicing a skill, it’s important to feel comfortable and safe, to know it’s okay to make mistakes because you can learn from them, and to see your partner as colleague that won’t judge you. So you need to connect with your partner as a human being.

Spend some time getting to know each other. Share information about yourself that you don’t know. You can use your own questions or you can use the following prompts to talk with your new partner(s) and get to know each other for 5 minutes.

# Coding challenges practice: intro

## Learning objectives

- Solve interview-like coding challenges.

### Estimated time: 1.5h

## Description
Coding challenges are the most common way to assess programming skills during the recruitment process.

You have been preparing for this part of the interview in the last months by learning the **theory about Algorithms & Data Structures** and by **solving coding challenges** corresponding to the Algorithms & Data Structures concepts. 

Even if you already have all the knowledge required to solve coding challenges, the more you practice the greater your opportunity to perform well during job interviews.

### Why is it important?

Some kind of coding challenge is a **must-have** during job interviews, so mastering them might be a crucial factor in your success.

The more coding challenges you solve, the greater the odds that **you will get a challenge similar to one you have already solved** during your job interview.

Also solving a lot of coding challenges will increase your confidence.

All of that will help you to manage your stress level and to perform better during job interviews.

### How to prepare mentally for coding challenges?

- Review the [cheatsheet](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/uploads/6/5/2/8/6528028/cracking_the_coding_skills_-_v6.pdf) created as a supplement to the above video.

### How to prepare practically for coding challenges?

- Practice your coding skills - solve as many coding challenges as possible.

During your job searching time at Micorverse, you will be asked to prepare for coding challenges in the recurring exercise.

#### Warning: don't rely on GitHub Copilot!

If you've ever played with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), you know how useful it can be during the development process. 

However, we **highly recommend NOT to use it during coding challenges**. This is because it will prevent you from learning how to solve challlenges by yourself, as well as appear to an interviewer as a cheating tool when you're in a technical interview.

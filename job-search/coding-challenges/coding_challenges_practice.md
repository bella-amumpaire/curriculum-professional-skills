# Coding challenges practice

## Learning objectives

- Solve interview-like coding challenges.

### Estimated time: 3h

## Exercise

As mentioned in the [Coding challenges practice: intro](./coding_challenges_practice.md), the only way to prepare for coding challenges is to **solve as many coding challenges as possible** in order to **understand how they work and how to best approach them**.

As this exercise is a recurring one, each time you will be able to select one (or more) challenges to solve.

**Note: It is your responsibility to select the coding challenge for a given day!**

### Instructions

1. Look for a coding challenge(s) (spend up to 0.5h on this) by browsing the following resources:

- [Get a random coding challenge in the 3rd row of the Mock Interview Generator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HkUyBZdcpGz_aEUa8W_rtNhS739jly8HY6sXVPPSAro/edit#gid=2041017957).
- [Get a random quick and simple coding challenge](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HkUyBZdcpGz_aEUa8W_rtNhS739jly8HY6sXVPPSAro/edit#gid=144653283).
- Solve coding challenges from [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/).
- Solve coding challenges from [codility.com](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/).
- Practice with [codechef.com](https://www.codechef.com/problems/challenge?page=0&limit=20&sort_by=difficulty_rating&sort_order=asc&search=&start_rating=-1&end_rating=10000&topic=&tags=&group=all).
- [Listen to the problem in this video. Pause and try to resolve it on your own, and only resume the video to get hints when/if you get blocked, or when you are done, just to compare your solution with the one in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UWDyJq8jZg).
- Play with code at [codinggame.com](https://www.codingame.com/home).

2. Timebox yourself [set up a timer for 2.5h](https://vclock.com/timer/#countdown=02:30:00&title=Coding+challenge+practice&sound=xylophone&loop=1).
3. Solve as much as possible in 2.5h:
   - Follow the advice from [Gayle Laakmann McDowell](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/uploads/6/5/2/8/6528028/cracking_the_coding_skills_-_v6.pdf).

**Note: We highly recommend you to disable [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) while you're solving codiing challenges. Especially when you're going through real technical interviews.**

# Review your networking plan and set SMART goals

## Learning objectives

- Set and achieve SMART goals for your networking efforts.
- Prepare a path to network with people from your dream companies and similar companies.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

In this lesson, you will review your long-term goal for networking and set the SMART goals that you want to achieve this month. To do so, you will refresh your understanding of what networking is and how to build your network.

### Why is building a professional network important?

You can be the best developer in the world but if nobody knows about you or your skills, then your chances of being hired — especially with a remote company — are greatly reduced. The internet has given us endless opportunities to connect with other people around the world. Networking allows you to put yourself and your work out there: to showcase your projects, and experiences, and connect with like-minded people in the industry. Many job opportunities -for today and for the future- come through connections, so it is a good idea to invest your time in building and maintaining your network.

### What is networking and how do you network?

There are different ways to build your professional network, such as participating in online communities and networks, attending technical events and meetups, and making contacts through family and friends. People from our personal circles might know someone that works in the tech sector!

But networking is a lot more than just making contact with people: it is about building a connection and establishing relationships -true, genuine relationships- and that includes both giving and receiving. Think of it as being similar to making friends in real life. And as you know, it requires a constant effort and takes time. It involves a lot more than simply reaching out to someone and asking for a job.

## Exercise

### Step 1: Define your networking big-picture goal

To organize your time and resources effectively, it’s important to have in mind goals: a clear vision of what you want to achieve will contribute to your motivation and help you focus on the essential tasks. You can establish goals at different levels and for different time frames, but it’s a good practice to begin with the big picture and a long-term perspective. The most common higher-level networking goals revolve around a chance to:

- Help you with your job search efforts in the future.
- Build your support community and be a part of the developer community.
- Build your profile and grow an online presence.
- Brand yourself as knowledgeable in your field.

Once you have defined your networking big-picture goal, it’s a good idea to plan your network and identify the qualities you want your network members to have: different roles (recruiters, developers, project managers), sectors and companies, skills or experience, and other commonalities with you (interests or locations, for example).

To get some ideas on how to plan your network, read the article ["Use research to plan a better network"](https://tribemineblog.com/use-research-to-plan-a-better-network/).

Since networking is a strategy to access your dream jobs, it’s useful to consider those dream jobs when thinking of your big-picture networking goal. In the core program, you created a list so it’s time to look at it again (if you didn’t make a list, do it now using [this lesson](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/define-your-dream-companies.md)).

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Open this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14UexNF3aZxtbH0mY39weG7EOlJr0ZEN96mqBkOa3Ilc/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Answer the questions in section 1 to make a list of the qualities you want your network to have (sectors, companies, roles, areas of expertise, location, or any other trait that is relevant to you).
3. In section 2, analyze the changes you need to make to your current professional network.

### Step 2: Set your networking SMART goals for next month

Once you have a clear vision of the professional network you want to build, you can set short-term goals that will help you move forward in that direction. Your starting point is the network that you have already created in the past few months and that you have mapped already, as well as the networking SMART goals that you included in your job search plan.

**Refresher on networking goal setting.**

[Setting better networking SMART goals](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/setting-better-smart-networking-goals.md).

1. Now, in section 3 of the template, set at least 3 SMART networking goals for the next month that will help you move forward toward your big-picture networking goal. Register each SMART goal in the first row of the tables included (remember the goal is ONE sentence) and use the questions in the row below to verify that your goal is SMART.
2. Finally, copy your networking goals to the job search plan you created in [this exercise](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/update-your-job-searching-plan-and-set-SMART-goals.md).

# Answering technical interview questions

## Learning objectives

- Practice answering technical interview questions in a mock interview setting.
- Communicate clearly and effectively in spoken English.
- Communicate technical concepts to other technical people.

### **Estimated time**: 2h

## Description

```
‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏èIMPORTANT NOTE:
In order to make the most out of this exercise you need to find a partner
who will play the role of your interviewer (in exchange you will do the same for them).
If you have a learning partner(s) assigned this is the way to go!

Otherwise, we recommend looking for a partner in your Morning session group
but you can contact anybody else from your cohort.
```

When asked a technical question, are you able to communicate your understanding with ease? If the answer is no, this lesson is for you!

In this lesson, you will practice your **technical articulation skills**. You will do so by practicing with a peer in a "mock interview"-type setting.

## Preparatory work

In order to do this exercise well you need to make sure you:

- Have a good understanding of core concepts
- Are able to articulate them easily and eloquently

A very effective way of getting there is to study with **flashcards**!

- [Daily practice - Flashcards with Brainscape](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12137352806419)

We recommend that you make this into a daily habit and spend **at least 5 minutes a day practicing with flashcards**.

## Exercise

> üí° Please make use of the [following rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Ee5kuxbSGMEBSAxdQJrukoa5f01Z7w9RSMPGq0QEYY/) while you go through the exercise.

Now that you've learned a better approach to answering technical questions, it's time to practice. When better than in a mock interview? Select one person and follow the instructions:

1. Collect a set of questions that will be used as interview questions - **(5 min)**
   - [JavaScript](https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions)
   - [React](https://github.com/sudheerj/reactjs-interview-questions)
   - [Ruby](https://github.com/nick-brown/ruby-interview-questions)
   - [Rails](https://gist.github.com/ahmadhasankhan/cfa1ae00a2533cf10ab2)
   - [SQL](https://github.com/xoraus/CrackingTheSQLInterview)
2. Answer 5 questions using our **recommended approach** about 1 of the aforementioned technologies - **(10 min)**
3. Give feedback on the answers: structure and content - **(10 min)**
4. _Switch roles and repeat_
5. _(if both people went) Change technology and repeat_

‚è∞ **Time**: 60 minutes per person

**Guiding questions:**

- Do you understand what the interviewer means by the terms they're using?
- Can you think of an example to illustrate the concept?
- Is there a pro and con regarding the usage of this concept or tool?

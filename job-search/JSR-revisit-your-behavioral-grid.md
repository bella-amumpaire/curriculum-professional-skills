# Revisit your behavioral grid

## Learning objectives

- Answer common behavioral questions in the CARL format.

### **Estimated time**: 1.5h

## Description

In a previous module you created the first version of your behavior grid with four stories based on a project or experience and using SAR. Now you will update these stories by applying the CARL (Context, Action, Result, Learning) format that you have just learned. You will also create a spreadsheet to integrate all the stories you have written into one file and add an additional story to each question.

### Why is editing your behavioral grid stories valuable?

One of the skills that companies value in junior software developers — and most professionals — is the ability to reflect on one’s own performance and to learn and grow from this reflection. Every time you share with recruiters a story about a past experience you have the chance to illustrate your self-reflection and learning skills. Thus, stating explicitly the lessons learned in any past experience is essential in your behavioral question answers.

On the other hand it’s also important to have several stories to choose from for the most common questions because you will then be able to tailor your answer to the specific needs and priorities of a company and a job position. For example you may answer “What challenges did you face in this position?” based on ANY of your past experiences. One of them might help you talk about your collaboration and communication skills in global and interdisciplinary teams; another can focus on your ability to learn new frameworks quickly and adapt to changing requirements, and yet another one will let you describe your ability to test applications.

Taking the time to draft each story and think carefully about what you want to say about the four elements in CARL format will help you give compelling answers to behavioral questions in your interview.

## Exercise

### Instructions

_If you need to refresh your memory about the CARL framework, review again [this lesson.](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/JSR-the-CARL-format.md)_

1. Open the [behavioral grid template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lbxS88VuPSFsF9dG_I7r8dhvIJP8Lywo8Xuf_Lt2pAw/edit?usp=sharing) in Gsheets.
2. Open the version of your behavioral grid that you have created.
3. Copy each of the stories you have created to the template, separating the **C**ontext (the situation in your original story), the **A**ctions, and the **R**esults.
4. Read the **R**esults carefully. Analyze if you cover both results and lessons learned, then separate them in the corresponding cells. If you haven’t described the lessons learned explicitly, add them now. Think of the long-term impact of the experience on you as a professional.
5. Copy the two stories that you created with the CARL framework and submitted to a coach for review to the template.
6. In your resume identify any software project or position you have NOT included already in your grid that can be useful to showcase your professional skills. This project can be from Microverse or it can be from another software experience. You may also consider other types of projects or experiences from your past.
   - Using the project or position identified above, write an answer to the behavioral questions in the grid following the CARL method.
   - Read the content of each element of your answers carefully (context, action, result, learning) carefully.

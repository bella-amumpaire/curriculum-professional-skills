## Description

To showcase your technical knowledge and skills effectively you should make sure you are **using terms in the correct way**.

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to best state your knowledge and skills in your application materials to make a more professional first impression!

### Why is correct terminology usage important?

Using the correct terminology shows that you have a deep understanding of the subject matter. It can give you **credibility** and make you appear more **knowledgeable** and **trustworthy** to others. This is especially important in software development, which includes a lot of technical jargon.

When you fail to use the correct terms in your application materials, others will likely _take you less seriously_ and this could reduce your chances of showcasing your expertise as a professional software developer.

### How to present your technical knowledge and skills effectively

The goal of your application materials is to **convince a hiring manager** of your expertise and skillset.

By following a **standardized style guide** that’s recognized industry-wide, you can prevent mistakes that might affect your credibility.

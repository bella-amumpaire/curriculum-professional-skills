# How to plan a good side project

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

After completing the core curriculum at Microverse, we strongly encourage you to start thinking about side projects you can build or contribute to.

Today we are going to help you pick and plan the right side project for you.

### Why is having a good side project important?

Working on a side project during your job search will be an asset for several reasons:

1. It helps you practice your skills daily which will keep them sharp, keeps you focused, and keeps your GitHub looking fresh.
2. Building projects can be a lot more fun than repeatedly practicing programming challenges in abstract (e.g. doing LeetCode challenges regularly) and you're more likely to deepen your knowledge by diversifying your experience.
3. The side projects give you an opportunity to meet people and make connections that could possibly lead to a job.
4. Continually expanding your portfolio with more projects will increase the odds that a recruiter or hiring manager will want to interview you when you apply to a position by making your application materials more attractive to them.

### Adding features to your Microverse projects

As a starting point, your side project can be adding features to the projects you completed during the core program to make them more complex and attractive, or checking them for bugs. This might be especially useful if you didn’t have coding experience before joining the program and these are the main projects in your portfolio.

Another initial project can be polishing your portfolio to make sure that it offers a compelling picture of your skills and stands out among others.

### Making contributions to open-source projects

Ideally, you should divide your time fairly evenly between building new projects of your own and contributing to open-source projects built by others. This last option is not easy, but it’s worth the effort. Developers who are active in the open source community and contribute to a wide range of projects tend to do better on the job market because they have a proven track record of contributing high-quality code to a range of projects and working well with others across cultures and time zones.
If you want to know how to get started, read:

- [Contributing to open source projects](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/contributing-to-open-source-projects.md)The following resources can help you get off to a good start:

### Working on your own projects

In addition to contributing to open source projects, it's very useful to build side projects that are all your own, or that you build with a team of equal partners. This gives you an opportunity to gain experience with defining a product and designing the user experience, defining project architecture, scoping the work, and performing routine maintenance, all of which are skills that will be useful to you as a developer at many companies.

### Showing off your work

Anytime you get contributions into someone else’s project or you finish a side project of your own, you should make sure to update your portfolio, social media profiles, and job application materials to show off your work.

Always make sure your six most impressive projects are pinned to your GitHub profile and that your most impressive projects are advertised front and center on your portfolio, LinkedIn profile, and Wellfound profile too.

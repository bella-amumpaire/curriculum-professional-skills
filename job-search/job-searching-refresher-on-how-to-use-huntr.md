### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

Today we're going to do a refresher on how to effectively track your job search progress using Huntr. 

### Why is using Huntr in the job search process important?

The job search process requires you to regularly  apply to multiple jobs. If you are just applying to jobs every day without tracking your progress, you could quickly lose motivation and momentum, and lose track of what you've already done, which could lead to giving up on the whole process. Job trackers like Huntr help you focus on your job search goals, see what actions you are taking to get closer to your goal and help you identify actions to take to improve your job search.

Throughout your job search, you will be using Huntr to track your job search progress.

### Using Huntr in the job search process

Huntr is the tool you will use to track your job applications, interviews, and job offers so you can see the status of each application as you progress through hiring pipelines.

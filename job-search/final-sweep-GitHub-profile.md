# Final Sweep: update your GitHub profile page

## **Learning objectives**

- Prepare a strong GitHub profile.

### **Estimated time: 1h**

## **Description**

In this exercise, you will review your GitHub profile and pin your six best projects.

## Why is it necessary to make one last round of revisions to your GitHub profile?

Remember that your GitHub profile is like your resume in the software world: it gives hiring managers an insight into who you are, what you've done, and what you're able to do, not only through the information you include in your bio and personal README, but also in the pinned projects that showcase your knowledge and skills. It is therefore very important that you make sure there are no mistakes, typos, or broken links, and that you select very carefully the projects that best highlight your abilities.

## Project setup

- Open up the revised version of your resume in Google Docs as a reference.
- Open all written and numerical resume feedback from your project reviewer(s). You can find written feedback on your dashboard for each project under the **Action-->View Reviews** button.
- Open the [GitHub profile rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A1x6Vqm6rmChKkb3T3IXBWRNyygTZ2oiHCPZq4IrXT4/edit?usp=sharing).
- Open the [walkthrough to create the first draft of your GitHub profile](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/becoming-a-remote-professional/create-the-first-draft-of-a-professional-looking-github-profile-page.md).

## Do a final sweep of your GitHub profile and pin your six best projects

As with other application materials, in the final sweep, it is important to read the different elements of your GitHub profile several times, checking specific aspects each time. You will also need to analyze carefully the projects that you have pinned, and maybe change or add new ones.

1. Begin by looking carefully at your GitHub profile; read your bio and personal README. Is the information complete and clear? Is there anything that needs to be corrected or updated? Review the changes you made to your resume in the final sweep and analyze if any of them applies to this profile also.
2. Check that all links work properly.
3. Make sure that you have pinned six complex, sophisticated projects, that showcase a range of technologies and your best projects. If you didn’t have programming experience before joining the Microverse program, you might have pinned one or two projects when you created your profile. It’s time to select some more and complete the number!
4. Read the project summary for each of your pinned projects and make sure it is a compelling and detailed description.
5. Look at the feedback that you received from your reviewers and verify that you made all the corrections they requested.
6. Using the rubric, now verify that your GitHub profile meets all the requirements. If necessary, make edits or complete the information. Refer to the walkthrough if you have questions about a particular section.
7. Check the spelling and grammar one last time. You can copy the text to a Google Doc and run it through Grammarly.

## Submission instructions

- You don’t need to submit the link to your revised GitHub profile page now. You will make one submission of the final sweep of all your application materials.
- When you finish reviewing your GitHub profile, go to the Student Dashboard and mark this activity as completed.

# Prepare a polished version of your elevator pitch to start the revision process

## **Learning objectives**

- Confidently pitch yourself in a short elevator pitch.

### **Estimated time:  2h**

## **Description**

In this exercise, you will refine your elevator pitch, record a video, and submit the text and the video to your coach for review.  Your coach will send you personalized feedback. Throughout the week, you will work together to polish it and ensure that your elevator pitch provides a compelling picture of yourself as a software developer.

## Refresher on your knowledge about elevator pitches

An elevator pitch is a brief description of your qualities as a software developer, which will help you build your case at different points of the job searching process. Thinking about how your elevator pitch can showcase your skills and strengths best will help you present yourself compellingly whenever necessary. Before revisiting your elevator pitch, review some key ideas related to this topic: 

- Refresh your memory about
 [Why are elevator pitches so useful?](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interviewing/why-are-elevator-pitches-so-useful.md).

- Review: [What is a Unique Selling Point](https://www.coburgbanks.co.uk/blog/candidate-tips/8-tips-to-developing-a-killer-usp/) and [How to create a USP for yourself](https://www.jobinterviewtools.com/why-should-i-hire-you-how-to-create-a-usp-that-compels-employers-to-hire-you/).

## Project setup

- Open up the latest version of your elevator pitch.
- Open your latest version of your USP. If you haven’t created one for yourself, do it now following this [walkthrough](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/imposter-syndrome/what-makes-you-unique-define-your-personal-usp.md).
- Open the [Assess your elevator pitch worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Szp-hmqtq5nTp-O8Bd0-1l7Znt5e5nw1nqfSe67tejE/edit#).

## **Exercise**

### **Instructions**

When looking for a remote job, you will need to present yourself in different contexts ranging from synchronous interactions with someone (a hiring manager or a peer) to asynchronous communication through various documents where you introduce yourself in writing. To be ready to explain your talents in a concise yet compelling way, it is essential to prepare your elevator pitch in written format and to practice presenting it orally.

In this exercise, you will refine your written elevator pitch using the [Assess your elevator pitch rubric and worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Szp-hmqtq5nTp-O8Bd0-1l7Znt5e5nw1nqfSe67tejE/edit#) as a reference to analyze whether or not it satisfies all the requirements. Then you will record a video of yourself reciting your pitch. You are now familiar with the strategy to refine an application material by going through it several times to look at specific aspects.

1. Begin by assessing the **length or duration** of your elevator pitch.
- Read it out loud and register how many seconds it takes.
- Select the score that best applies and analyze whether or not you need to shorten or lengthen your elevator pitch.
- Make any necessary edits.
- Remember, an elevator pitch should be short! On paper, only a few sentences. Only 40-60 questions spoken. 

2. Continue by looking at the **content** of your elevator pitch.
- Familiarize yourself with the first requirement in section 1 of the worksheet.
- Read your elevator pitch and analyze the content you should have included.
- Select the score that best applies to your elevator pitch and identify any improvement required. Then, make the necessary changes using the learning resources provided as a reference.
- Repeat this process for all the requirements in section 1.

3. Now assess the **grammar and style** of your elevator speech.
- Familiarize yourself with the first requirement listed in section 3 of the worksheet.
- Using Grammarly, identify any grammar or spelling mistakes that you have made and correct them.
- Select the score that best applies to your elevator pitch.
- Read the second requirement listed in section 3 of the worksheet.
- Reread your elevator pitch, analyzing whether or not you are using varied sentence types.

4. Finally, practice presenting your elevator pitch orally and record a video of yourself. You have already recorded this once during the core program. Follow the same steps:
- Time estimated: 5 minutes: Take 5 minutes to read through your pitch and highlight one keyword to help you remember each paragraph of your pitch. So, for example, if your pitch contains 3 sections, you should have 3 keywords. Then, memorize your keywords and read through your pitch again so you can see how your chosen keywords will help you remember your pitch.
- Time estimated: 10 minutes: Now put the pitch away and stand in front of a mirror. Practice your pitch solo by using keywords to help you remember significant parts of your pitch. Next, recite your pitch in front of the mirror. If you forget what you wanted to say, take a quick look at your keywords or pitch, and then continue reciting in front of your mirror.
- Time estimated: 10 minutes: Still standing in front of your mirror, recite your pitch with your eyes closed. Recite it while making silly faces, and recite it while smiling. You will have many more opportunities to practice this.
- Time estimated: 5 minutes: Once you have practiced reciting your pitch, record a video of yourself delivering the elevator pitch. Look at the webcam while speaking, and try not to read directly from the script.
 
After reviewing your elevator pitch and recording your video, create a Google Doc with all the links using this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kCOinA8mmoKtvSx1t5yHXzJrNtr2G9UuKQ-ANkvA0EE/edit#heading=h.4ol9h8a7cx3g).

### Submit your exercise

*Read [this FAQ](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234) for a reminder on how to submit your exercise.*

Now go to your Student Dashboard and submit the **link to your Gdoc with both versions of your polished elevator pitch** so that your coach can review it and give you feedback. 

**Remember to submit your document no later than Wednesday on the week it's due, so that coaches have enough time for the review process.**

# Time booked to work on your portfolio or application materials

### Estimated time: 1h

## **Description**

Now, continue updating your portfolio or your application materials until career coaches approve them. 

If coaches request changes, make all the edits and ask for a new review. You have a **max of 3 reviews** for these projects. Consider that:
- Polishing your behavioral grid, portfolio, LinkedIn profile, GitHub profile, and resume are carry-over activity, so you have two weeks to get the projects approved. The first three are due by the end of Block 2 and the last two, by the end of Block 3.
- Creating a cover letter is a core requirement and you must complete it in Block 3.

### How should you use the time booked for making project changes?

As in other projects, we give you flexibility. Use the time as it best fits your schedule. Your goal is to get an approved version of your portfolio and all application materials by the deadline to avoid a block repetition.


### What should you do if you need more time for project changes than the amount booked?

The time booked for the project changes is an estimate, so it is ok if it occasionally takes you longer to complete this project. 

**Remember that compelling application materials and a strong portfolio are essential to get an amazing job!**

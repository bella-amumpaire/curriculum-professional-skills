# Final Sweep: create a strong cover letter

## **Learning objectives**

- Write a clear, compelling cover letter.

### **Estimated time: 1.5h**

## **Description**

In this exercise, you will rewrite your cover letter to customize it for a new job posting, before submitting it to your career coach.

## Why is it important to become skillful in creating customized cover letters for each job application?

Cover letters are a gateway to getting interviews because they give hiring managers a quick perspective of who you are and why you are a good fit for the job you are applying to. Thus, a compelling cover letter might make a difference in your chances of moving forward in the recruitment process.

Now, learning how to write customized cover letters that get you interviews is not easy and it will require lots of practice and a sustained effort from you. Your first attempts might not be perfect, but, don’t worry! It’s a skill that you can develop with the feedback and support from your coach reviewer. As a starting point, it’s important that you submit the best possible cover letter you can create in the final sweep. This will give your coach a clear idea of your strengths when writing cover letters as well as an insight into the challenges you are facing.

## Project setup

- Open up in Google Docs the cover letter that you wrote in Module 5.
- Open all the written and numerical feedback that you received from your project reviewer(s) about your cover letter. You can find written feedback on your dashboard for each project under the **Action-->View Reviews** button.
- Open the [cover letter rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kiQP_QOxy2Opklleet37kCXbB8uRndRPumtfzKtR9N0/edit).
- Open the [walkthrough to create a first version of your cover letter](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/write-and-submit-a-customized-cover-letter.md).

## Create a customized cover letter for a job posting

Using the cover letter that you wrote in Module 5 as a reference, write a cover letter for a new job posting. Remember that compelling cover letters tell a story about you, your knowledge, skills, and previous experience, in the context of a specific role in a particular company. As in other final sweep activities, it’s important to read through your cover letter and edit the content several times, with different intentions.

1. Select a job posting that you are interested in applying to. You can refer to the resource [“Where do I find jobs to apply to?](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/where-do-I-find-jobs-to-apply-to.md) for ideas on where to look.
2. Read the job posting carefully and spend 10 - 15 minutes doing some research about the company. Find at least 2 -3 reasons why you would want that job.
3. Read the cover letter that you wrote in Module 5 and identify the skills and attributes that your are highlighting.
4. Read the feedback that you received from reviewers and make sure you made the required changes.
5. Make a copy of the cover letter that you wrote in Module 5 so that you can edit it for the new job posting that you have selected. Begin by looking at the heading; verify that the content is complete and all links are functional.
6. Continue with the different paragraphs: introduction, first, second, third, and conclusion. Read each one of them carefully and rewrite or make any necessary edits to align it with the new position and company. If you need a reminder of how you should address in each paragraph, refer to the walkthrough [Write and submit a customized cover letter](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/write-and-submit-a-customized-cover-letter.md).
7. Now, look at the format of your cover letter: margins, line spacing, fonts. Is it attractive and consistent?
8. Read the letter one more time to analyze the story that you are telling. Focus on how ideas flow and how one paragraph connects with the other. Are you communicating why you are fit for that specific job? Give your text one more round of edits if it is required to make your story more compelling.
9. Open the rubric and verify that your cover letter meets all the criteria.
10. Finally, check the grammar and spelling of your cover letter. Run it through Grammarly.

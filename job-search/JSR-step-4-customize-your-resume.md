# Step 4: Customize your resume

## Learning objectives

- Create a strong resume that will pass ATS systems.

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Description

In this exercise you will customize your resume to include keywords from the job posting and the company’s website, before sending your job application. 

This version of your resume will not be reviewed by a coach; you will send it with your application!

### Why is it important to customize your resume?

Your chances of being selected for an interview increase If recruiters or applicant tracking systems (ATS) find the knowledge and skills they consider essential in your application materials. And it might be a matter of words for that to happen! 

For example you may have included **critical thinking** and **problem solving** in the skills section of your resume while the job description might instead refer to it as **analytical skills**. If an ATS is looking only for the latter term, your resume might not be selected even though you possess the skills. A simple change to align the terms you use in your resume with those of the company would have made the difference.

### Where do I find the keywords to include?

You should look at the job descriptions and the company’s website. Begin by analyzing the job posting you are applying to, but look at other job descriptions too. Common skills mentioned in multiple job postings are attributes valued throughout the organization and you can identify the exact wording they use in each case. Then review the company’s website looking for attributes that are relevant to the organization as well.

The good news is that in Step 2: Research the company you have already studied the job posting, the company’s website, and identified some keywords. If you followed our instructions, you have registered them in Table D of your version of the [First steps in submitting a job application](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bz0Ute5_3onmFAM-coVFM7zRX4MoC-XZwq6xRSGN2E4/edit#) template.

### How do you customize your resume?

You need to change the wording in your approved resume to ensure it refers to skills and activities using the same terms in the job posting and the company’s website. Read the following article to learn how to do it:

## Project setup

1. Open the job description that you have selected to apply to.
2. Open the latest version of your resume.
3. Open the version of the template: [First steps in submitting a job application](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bz0Ute5_3onmFAM-coVFM7zRX4MoC-XZwq6xRSGN2E4/edit?usp=sharing) you created in Step 2: Research the company.

**In this exercise you won’t use a template. You will work directly on your resume.**

## Exercise

### Instructions

1. Make a copy of your approved resume. It’s a good idea to keep a copy of the original one that you can either send as-is or use it as the starting point to prepare customized versions. 
2. Look at the keywords that you identified when you researched the company. You should have listed them in Table D of the template you used in Step 2. If you haven’t identified them:
    - Print or copy the job posting to an editable file. Read the job posting carefully and highlight the keywords that you find.
    - Look at the company’s website and see what words and phrases they use to describe their mission, values, and services.
3. Go through your resume and find where you can include those keywords. Make the necessary edits.
    - In your work experience, see if you have performed similar tasks to the ones required for the job and if you can align the phrasing in your bullets accordingly. You can use the same action verb (manage, organize?) or object (a web app, customer service tickets?). Without lying of course!
    - In your knowledge and skills section, ensure that you use the exact terms for a skill as those used in the job description.
    - Also consider in your summary some of the keywords. Again don’t lie about your professional strengths and goals, but you want to ensure that the similarities between your interests, goals, knowledge, and skills, and the company’s requirements and challenges are easily spotted.

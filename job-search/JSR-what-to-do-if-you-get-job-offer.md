A **job offer** is when an employer formally invites you to work for their company. How exciting!

In this lesson you'll get a quick refresher on:

- What is a job offer
- How to best approach job offers
- How to negotiate for better benefits

## What is a job offer

The term **job offer** refers to an offer of employment made directly to an applicant to fill a role within their company. This could be in various constructions: to work for the company for a fixed monthly fee, on a short-term contract, or a freelance basis.

In simple terms it's when a hiring manager deems you fit for the job and wants to pay you to do it!

An offer gets extended after an applicant has **passed the screening** of a hiring process (not when a recruiter sends you a message on LinkedIn):

- Documents have been approved (e.g. CV, cover letter),
- Interviews went successfully
- Management made a final decision to want to hire the applicant

This results in a **job offer letter** (whether in email or written form), that includes information on:

- Salary and other benefits
- Job title
- Responsibilities
- Conditions of employment
- Starting date

Once you've received it, it's up to you to decide how to move forward.

## How to best approach job offers

You just got offered a job. First of all, congratulations! Youâ€™ve worked incredibly hard to get here, and everyone at Microverse is extremely proud to have helped you in whatever small way!

Now what do you do next?

### Take some time to think about the offer before accepting

**Let the hiring manager know you're grateful** for the opportunity. But afterward politely **ask for 2-3 days to go over the details** of the job offer. To give them more clarity **give them a date** by which you will give your decision.

### Consider your personal and professional priorities

Do you have a family to support financially? If so, you might want to go for a higher salary than if you lived by yourself.

Is this position remote, hybrid, or completely in-person? A job that pays well but requires time commuting may not be worthwhile if there is an opportunity that pays slightly less but allows you to save a lot of time by working from home.

### Inspect the role description

What are the **daily responsibilities** of this job? You'll spend a big part of your life at work so it's important to be happy about the tasks you'll have to do daily.

Is the role description **aligned with the direction you want your career to go**? If you'll be working on things that you're not seeing yourself doing in the next years, you might have to rethink if the job makes sense.

If these (or other) factors in the offer don't work for you, it's acceptable to discuss these with your hiring manager.

## How to negotiate for better benefits

Now that you have a better idea of the job offer, your priorities, and the role description, it's time to come up with a **counteroffer letter**. However, you don't have to do this alone!

### Share the offer with Microverse

We are here to help you get the best deal possible. So when you receive a job offer **share it with us** as well! We have created a simple process you can follow:

1. Fill out the [New or Updated Job Offer form](https://airtable.com/shrHyefik2tK4E4qo)

3. (optional) Submit a Zendesk ticket to the Career Services on-call career coach

This way you can connect to a career coach who's helped countless other Micronauts get the best deal possible.

### Writing a counteroffer letter

When you start determining a counteroffer, keep in mind the **factors you're not in agreement with**.

Then **use the following structure** to write down your counteroffer:

*Current offer - Your counteroffer - Reasons and supporting facts or data for the counteroffer*

An example of this is the following:

*(Current offer) The salary offer of $1000/month is generous, but (counteroffer) I'd like to counteroffer with $1200. (Reasons) Based on my experience and the current market average this seems to be more fitting.*

Make sure to **ask your career coach to review your counterproposal** before sending anything out!

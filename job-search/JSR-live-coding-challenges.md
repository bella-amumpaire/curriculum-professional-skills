# Succeeding at live coding challenges

## Learning objectives

- Solve simple interview-like coding challenges.
- Demonstrate ability to deal with common issues during the live coding session part of a technical interview.
- Provide feedback to a peer after a mock interview.

### **Estimated time**: 2h

## Description

```
‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏èIMPORTANT NOTE:
In order to make the most out of this exercise you need to find a partner
who will play the role of your interviewer (in exchange you will do the same for them).
If you have a learning partner(s) assigned this is the way to go!

Otherwise, we recommend looking for a partner in your Morning session group
but you can contact anybody else from your cohort.
```

When asked to solve a coding challenge, do you jump right into coding? If so, you've been approaching coding challenges the wrong way!

In this lesson, you will practice your **live coding skills**. 
## Preparatory work

In order to do this exercise well you need to make sure you:

- Have a good understanding of common patterns for coding challenges
- Have mastered best practices before, during and after a coding interview
- Have [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) turned off

### Common patterns for coding challenges

While there are an infinite amount of coding challenges, there are only a limited amount of patterns that can solve them. When you learn these you'll be able to recognize what type of challenge you're facing and know how to solve them. The following are a starting point:

- [Two Pointers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gjxg6Pln50)
- [Sliding Window](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK-NZ4hN7rs)
- [Tortoise and Hare Two Pointer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGu9C6_rUI)

### Best practices

A coding challenge is more than just the actual code you have to write. Study up on the best practices (technical and behavioral) in order to show your expertise well before, during and after!

## Exercise

> üí° Please make use of the [following rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18oP47pnzkLsy01T6220CvaxQhbhh061XmC8tTqVkYOQ) while you go through the exercise.

The best way to improve your live coding skill is to practice often. When better than in a mock interview? Together with a peer you are instructed to:

1. Decide who is going to be the interviewer and interviewee
2. The interviewer chooses an **easy** coding challenge - **(1 min)**
   - üëâ [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/?difficulty=EASY)
3. The interviewee will **solve the challenge** using the method mentioned above - **(20 min)**
4. After the challenge is solved the **interviewer will give feedback** - **(10 min)**
5. _Switch roles and repeat 2 times total per person_

**‚è∞ Time**: 20 minutes person per coding challenge & 10 minutes for feedback = 60 minutes per person total

**Guiding questions:**

- Does this challenge match any patterns you've seen before?
- What's the most efficient data structure to use?
- Are there any well-known algorithms (i.e. recursion or sorting) you can use?
- Could there be any edge cases to look out for?

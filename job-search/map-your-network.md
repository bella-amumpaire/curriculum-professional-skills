# Map your professional network

## Learning objectives

- Analyze the relationships and circles in your professional network.

### **Estimated time**: .75hr

## Description

In this exercise, you will identify the members of your professional network and the different kinds of relationships that you have established with them as input for planning your networking activities.

**Plan to spend about 20 minutes doing the reading part of this exercise to allow sufficient time for the exercise.**

### Why is it important to map your network?

A robust professional network is essential to developing professionally and finding a job. Now that you will be job searching intensively, a critical activity in your schedule will be networking. You learned several strategies to build your network and started applying them during the core program. By mapping your network, you can analyze what you have achieved. It will also be helpful to define where you have to focus your efforts next. 

### Connections and circles in your network

A professional network consists of people you connect with and interact with in distinct ways and times. Some are very close relations with whom you often communicate, and you constantly give support and receive support from. But, on the other hand, you occasionally interact with others and don’t offer or receive much support. 

Thus, your network includes a range of relationships that are closer or more distant from you. To achieve your professional goals, you can target your networking efforts to change the nature of some of your relationships with the members of your network.

- How is your communication different with people from each circle of your network?

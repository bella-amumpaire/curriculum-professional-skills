# Final Sweep: revamp your elevator pitch

## **Learning objectives**

- Confidently pitch yourself in a short Elevator Pitch.

### **Estimated time: 1h**

## **Description**

In this exercise, you will review and update your Elevator Pitch before sending it to your coach for review.

## Why is it important to update your Elevator Pitch?

You are constantly evolving as a software developer, mastering new technologies and frameworks, and developing professional skills. Each project that you code teaches you something: who you are and what makes you special changes with time, as you go through learning and professional experiences.

In Module 2, you drafted the first version of your elevator pitch. Since you will focus on job searching now, it’s important that you look at it once again and make any necessary edits to describe your current technical and professional abilities. In the following weeks, you will be using this speech to convince others that you are the right person for a role.

## Project setup

- Open up in Google Docs the elevator pitch that you wrote in Module 2.
- Open all the written and numerical feedback that you received from your project reviewer(s) about your elevator pitch. You can find written feedback on your dashboard for each project under the **Action-->View Reviews** button.
- Open the [elevator pitch rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ULe_jeJfj38Pm_Aj_jqVkUVyL8E-dJn6inLB1ITcUF8/edit).
- Open the [walkthrough to create a first version of your elevator pitch](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interviewing/use-your-usp-to-craft-the-first-draft-of-your-elevator-pitch.md).

## Review your elevator pitch

Your elevator pitch is a speech that you share orally when applying to jobs. In this case, besides reading and editing it in written format, it’s important to read it out loud and to check how it sounds.

1. Read the elevator pitch that you created in Module 2 and study the content. Does it highlight what makes you special as a software developer? Add any skills or attributes that you have developed since you wrote your first version and were not included.
2. Read the feedback that you received from reviewers and make sure you made the required changes.
3. Using the rubric, read your elevator pitch again to verify that it meets all of the requirements. If necessary, complete information or make edits. Refer to the walkthrough if you have questions about a particular section.
4. Read it once more, this time out loud. How does it sound? Do the phrases flow smoothly? Identify phrases that don’t sound right and correct them.
5. Check the spelling and grammar. Run it through Grammarly.

## Submission instructions

- Save this new version of your elevator pitch in Google Drive with the file name: Final_sweep_coverletter_yourname.
- You don’t need to submit the revised version of your elevator pitch now. You will do one final submission of all of your application materials.
- When you finish updating your elevator pitch, go to the Student Dashboard and mark this activity as completed.

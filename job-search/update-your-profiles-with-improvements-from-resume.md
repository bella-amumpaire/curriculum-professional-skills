# Update your profiles with improvements from your resume

## Learning objectives

- Create a clear, compelling LinkedIn page.
- Create a clear, compelling Wellfound profile.
- Prepare a strong GitHub profile.

### **Estimated time: 2h**

## **Description**

Once you have updated your resume, integrate the same changes into the professional profiles that you created during the core program: LinkedIn, Wellfound and GitHub, so that they also provide a compelling picture of your skillset.

**Your polished version of the profiles will not be reviewed by your coach at this moment, but they will be ready for your job applications**.

## Project setup

- Open up the latest version of your resume in Google Docs
- Open your LinkedIn, Wellfound and GitHub profiles
- Open your notes of the changes that you implemented last week on your resume, if you registered them

## **Exercise**

### **Instructions**

_Check out this FAQ if you need a refresher on [Google Doc submission best practices](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063156813)_

1. Update your LinkedIn, Wellfound and GitHub profiles, considering the changes you made to your resume last week. You can use one of the following to strategies:

   - Strategy A: Open each profile, reat through the different sections, and identify if there area any changes that you made in your resume last week that also apply here. Make the changes.

   - Strategy B: Open the three profiles and your resume. Read through a section (for example, Education) and identify the changes that you made to your resume that also apply in the profiles. Edit this section in the three profiles at the same time.

If you need to refresh your memory on how to complete any of the sections of these profiles, refer to the walkthrough that you studied in the core program:

- [Create the first draft of a professional LinkedIn page](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/create-first-draft-of-a-professional-linkedin-page.md)
- [Create a first draft of a professional-looking GitHub profile](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/becoming-a-remote-professional/create-the-first-draft-of-a-professional-looking-github-profile-page.md)
- [Create a first draft of your Wellfound profile](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/create-the-first-draft-of-your-angellist-profile.md)

2. Create a Google Doc with the link to your three profiles, using the exercise [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13tEhJicRf93qYczyecN1xtHfiuNjljE-mXRXRXzWscU/edit?usp=sharing).

### Submit your exercise

_Read [this FAQ](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234) for a reminder on how to submit your exercise._

Now go to your Student Dashboard and submit a Google Doc with the link to your three profiles. This submission will be saved as part of your academic work, but **the profiles will not be reviewed by your coach at this moment**.

# How to submit a job application

## Learning objectives

- Identify 5 places you can search for remote jobs online.
- Select fitting jobs to apply to from a list of available positions.

### **Estimated time**: 2h

## Description

In this exercise, you will submit a job application and refresh your knowledge about how to perform the different steps in the process. Then, starting tomorrow, you will use these steps to submit your daily 2 - 4 job applications.

### Why is it important?

Submitting job applications is a task you will perform every day when you are job searching. The critical steps in this process are: 
- finding the job openings 
- analyzing them to decide if it’s worth it for you to apply 
- researching the position and the company
- customizing your application materials 
- sending the application

You have studied how to complete job applications during the core program, but we will now guide you step by step to refresh your knowledge and skills. We will also point you to the resources available to support you and offer suggestions on how to tailor your efforts to maximize your chances of being invited for interviews.  

When sending applications, there is a tradeoff between quality and quantity. Customizing your resume and cover letter carefully and researching the position and the company will take a lot of time and effort. Yet, this will increase your chances of standing out and being invited to an interview. At the same time, sending many applications -maybe not so carefully crafted- will also increase your chances of finding that job opportunity that is right for you. So it’s crucial to combine a personalized approach while simultaneously using brute force and sending many applications without so much customization. The challenge for you is deciding where to target your time and efforts.

## Exercise
 
### Step 1: Find an online job to apply to

You have many options for finding job opportunities: you can search online on websites that publish listings, get referrals from your professional or personal network, or find those hidden jobs (those that are not yet available). For this exercise, you will use the first resource, because it is one that you can access every day.

**Refresh your knowledge about resources for finding jobs**

Many websites list job openings and specialize in certain types of jobs. Try different ones and identify those that match your interests and needs. In the article below you will find an extensive list of websites you can visit to find jobs. 

[Where do I find jobs to apply to?](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/where-do-I-find-jobs-to-apply-to.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Use one of these resources to find a job position you would like to apply for.

### Step 2: Add the job listing to your Job Application Tracking Sheet

The two tricks to efficient job searching are consistency and retrospection. First, you need to apply to a consistent amount of jobs every week, and you need to be able to track the status of each job you apply to. Then, over time, you need to see how many jobs you applied to, at which stage of the hiring process you dropped off, and how you can improve to get your final offer. This is where this [Job Application Tracking Sheet]((https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dc-U5o5XeJh7IndAUbw_yyyxbi6Vm7ddzveB5jDoC7w/edit#gid=815296917) comes in to help you.  Utilize this tool to keep tabs on your applications. It's a straightforward tool that consolidates all your job applications in one place, enabling you to update the status of each application and stay informed about which companies you've contacted.



**Apply what you've learned**

1. If you haven’t done it yet, duplicate [Job Application Tracking Sheet]((https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dc-U5o5XeJh7IndAUbw_yyyxbi6Vm7ddzveB5jDoC7w/edit#gid=815296917) and save it for your records.
2. Check out job openings at potential employers. Add a promising match to a row under the columns "Company" and "Job Posting," including the role name or URL for easy access. Note the discovery date under "Date Job Was Found" to track application deadlines.



### Step 3: Analyze if the job is fit for you

Not all job postings are created equal! Some might be a better fit than others. Therefore, before sending a job application, it’s essential to carefully read the description and decide if it is a good fit for you. 

Read the following article to refresh your memory on the information that will help you make this decision: 

[Pointers to consider when searching for a good-fitting job](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/pointers-to-consider-when-searching-for-a-good-fitting-job.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Read the description of the selected job opening carefully and look for the pointers described in the article. Register your findings in Section 1 of [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13traiMD2fp_dn5bVS5nUtXmBVQDmz9q_Z7p727NnsjE/edit#heading=h.yegj1fdxqsoo).
2. Decide if the job is a good fit for you so that it’s worth investing your time and effort in customizing your application materials. If it is, continue with the next step. If you decide it’s not, go back to Step 1 and look for another job opening.
 
### Step 4: Do research on the company and customize your resume and cover letter

Since companies receive large numbers of applications for a position, it’s essential to ensure that your application materials highlight why you are a good candidate for that specific role in that particular company. To craft your arguments, you need to research the company and analyze the job description to identify the key attributes and skills they are looking for. Note key words that appear in the job description to include them in your application materials to increase your chances of being selected by the applicant tracking systems (ATS) used by some companies for automatic screening.

As you learn about the job, it’s a good idea to reflect upon what excites you about that position and how you can contribute to the company. Make notes of ideas that come to your mind about why you are a good fit for the position. Then, if you discover new evidence that changes your decision about the job, you can always go back to step 1 and find another job opportunity.

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Research the company you are applying to and note relevant information for your application. 
2. Look carefully at your resume and identify if any edits would make you stand out for that particular job. Then, go ahead and customize it.
3. Read the cover letter that you created in the core program and customize it for the position you are applying for. 

### Step 5: Send the job application and register this fact in the Job Application Tracking Sheet

As you have experienced, submitting customized job applications involves time and effort. This investment is worthwhile for the jobs that are especially interesting for you for different reasons. Still, you cannot invest the same amount of time in them if you meet our recommendation of sending between 2 and 4 applications daily. The trick is to make strategic decisions once you find a job opportunity. How close is it to your dream job? Is there something that makes you a good fit for that position? Are there required attributes that you are missing? Decide if you want to apply for the job and how much time and effort you will invest in customizing your application materials.

In some cases, it can be worth applying for a job even though you don’t meet all the requirements or are not 100% sure about the company. You never know whether the recruiter will select you for some other reason. And, if they invite you for an interview, you can always revisit your decision.


**Apply what you've learned**

1. Submit your job application.
2. Go to your personal Job Application Tracking Sheet and check "Yes" under the "Apply" column and note the date. 
3. Copy the link to your personal Job Application Tracking Sheet.

## Refresher about the relevance of a LinkedIn profile 

LinkedIn is one of the most used platforms for hiring professionals, so crafting your profile carefully and keeping it updated and active can impact your chances of moving through the recruitment process. You can also find job postings here, meet and interact with other professionals, and build your personal brand by sharing your knowledge with others in periodic posts.

## Project setup

- Open up your LinkedIn profile.
- Open the latest version of your resume. 
- Open the [Assess your LinkedIn profile rubric and worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W-BN3mKAyJAn-Kdw4QuyZU-MiF6TIG1PZrSv4Hdjcug/edit#heading=h.49ezt9nvjk6d​​).

## **Exercise**

### **Instructions**

Your LinkedIn profile consists of a header with a summarized introduction to who you are, and different sections with information about specific attributes. You created the first version of your profile during the core program and have already updated it several times afterward. Since you have finished the core program and have been job searching for some weeks intensively, your LinkedIn profile should be complete and comprehensive. It should also show that you are an active professional by including posts and publications.  

Use the [Assess your LinkedIn profile rubric and worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W-BN3mKAyJAn-Kdw4QuyZU-MiF6TIG1PZrSv4Hdjcug/edit#heading=h.49ezt9nvjk6d​​) as a reference to review each of the sections of your LinkedIn profile and make any necessary improvements, before submitting it to your coach and refining it with their feedback.

1. Begin by looking at the Header first.
- Read the requirements listed in section 1 of the worksheet.
- Look closely at the different components of the Header section of your profile and analyze whether or not you meet the requirements.
- Select the score that best applies and identify any improvements required. Refer to the learning resources applicable.
- Make any necessary changes.

2. Follow this same process to review sections 2 to 7. As you do so, verify that you provide a comprehensive perspective of your skills and knowledge and include the projects and publications you have completed. 

3. Continue with section 8 and review the spelling and grammar of every section in your LinkedIn profile.

4. Assess if you have been active on LinkedIn by looking at section 9 and selecting the score for your profile. If you haven’t been active on LinkedIn, start right away and publish your first post! It can be an article of your own or a reference to an exciting resource for software developers. After that, make a plan to publish posts periodically.

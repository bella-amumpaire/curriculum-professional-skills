# Refresher: following up after applications and interviews

## Learning objectives

- Demonstrate how to reach out to an interviewer after the interview with an effective note.
- Demonstrate ability to find a hiring manager or recruiter's contact information and reach out to them after submitting an application.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5h

## Description

In this lesson you will review how to send follow-up messages after sending applications or having interviews. 

### Why is it important to send a follow-up message?

Sometimes it might take a long time to hear from recruiters after you go through a stage in the recruitment process. Writing a follow-up message is a way to get some information early on. Also sending such a note allows you to show your interest in the job and demonstrate your professional skills; particularly your ability to communicate in a work environment. So a carefully-written follow-up after sending a job application can help you stand out as a conscientious, courteous, and respectful software developer.

### What do I need to know about sending follow-up messages?

Your messages at the different stages of the recruitment process should fulfill different purposes and require a different approach and content: writing a follow-up after a job application is not the same as following up after having an interview. In the first case you are interested in finding out if you're still under consideration for the position. In the second case you're hoping to leave your interviewer(s) with a good impression of you.

In a previous module, you studied how to write messages for these two situations. Now to self-assess your understanding of the nuances of sending different follow-up messages, answer [this quiz](https://forms.gle/Gh2GzsRWo6D7vADH8). It will not be graded but you can check your answers and get feedback for each question.

### Sample emails

Since writing can be a challenging endeavor, you can refer to the examples we have prepared for inspiration to craft your follow-up emails. Here is an easy-to-use version in Google Docs:

- [Follow-up email after a job application](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z7ecitH3KPASnVcKFfiVVP72RD2S37yTDoVlt3HCNX4/edit#)
- [Follow-up email after an interview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eKaD6A8YUJMYmaDF1wvafXSEtPWAVoTY2UgqO-ThSXY/edit?usp=sharing)

Remember to always customize your messages with recruiters or interviewers. Each written interaction is your chance to establish a personal connection with them that may be useful even if you donâ€™t get the job!

Start drafting your message now. Once you start job searching, you will be assigned a coach who can review it before you send it for the first time.

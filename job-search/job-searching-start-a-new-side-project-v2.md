# Start a new side project

### **Estimated time**: 1hr

## Introduction

Today you are going to make a start on your side project and define what you plan to build this month.

### Why is working on side projects important?

Working on side projects is important for a variety of reasons.

Firstly, this is a great way to keep your Github profile green and therefore give hiring managers insight into who you are, what you've done, and what you're able to do.

Secondly, by practicing you will keep your coding skills sharp. This will give you confidence when starting your new job.

And thirdly, new projects mean new things to talk about in interviews! You'll never run out of interesting things to share with recruiters and hiring managers.

**Note** - If you haven't created a [web development portfolio](https://45royale.com/blog/web-developer-portfolio/) or you haven't looked at your portfolio in a long time, you should plan your first side project to be either creating or overhauling your portfolio. That way you'll have a way to showcase your work to employers, as well as something to keep coding while you're job searching :) You can use [this walkthrough to creating an awesome portfolio](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/creating-your-portfolio.md) to guide you through the process.

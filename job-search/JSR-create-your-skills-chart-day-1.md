# Create your skills chart - day 1

## Learning objectives:

- Identify personal skills and attributes that make you unique as a future job searcher / employee.

### **Estimated time**: 2h

## Description

This exercise will guide you to identify and describe your transferable skills using stories of your past experiences as a reference. You will create a chart with a detailed description of your top skills that will help you have a clear picture of who you are and what you can bring to a job. This is an essential step to convincing others to hire you!

Self-reflection is not a simple or easy process, but it‚Äôs essential to help you highlight personal attributes in your application materials and during interviews.

You will complete the exercise in two days:

- Today you will write your stories and analyze the skills you evidenced in each case.
- Tomorrow you will identify your top ten skills and prepare a more detailed description of them.

### Why is it important to have a skills chart?

Most of the time you will be one of the many candidates that apply for a job and your challenge will be to convince the recruiter and other members of the recruiting team to hire you. Other candidates might be as good or even better coders than you, but other skills you master can help you to stand out and be selected.

**Transferable skills** refer to those you can bring from one job to another. Think of them as ‚Äúportable skills‚Äù because you can apply them regardless of the field, industry, position, work environment, and even within different career paths. All of us have some skills that make us unique.

These skills are also timeless so they can benefit you throughout your career. Other names they can be called by are life skills, basic skills, key skills, generic skills, key competencies, and essential competencies, among others. Transferable skills include both technical and non-technical skills that you have.

The challenge is finding out what your transferable skills are. According to Richard Nelson, writer of the book _What color is your parachute?_ 95% of all workers don‚Äôt know them. So he designed the following five-step exercise to help people figure out their skills. We have adapted it for Micronauts. The good news is that you don‚Äôt necessarily need years of working experience. Instead you can consider your experiences in school, volunteer work, internships, extracurriculars, or just life experiences.

### Project setup

1. Open the template for [Your stories and skills](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OCywwNXU4OewPFVaYqOCWBxN4h8O-FuFtVTQjD6Ea3M/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Open the [Parachute Skills Grid](http://content.randomhouse.com/assets/9780399579653/view.php?id=9780399579653a017) to use as a reference.

### Step 1: **Write your first story about an episode in your life (first of seven)**

Begin by writing a story about an event in your past that you have enjoyed in Table A of the template. Describe any situation where you accomplished something. A moment that you are proud of. Make it short, descriptive, and around 300 words long.

As you read this you may be thinking: ‚ÄúWrite? I don‚Äôt like to write! And a story about me?‚Äù It would seem that writers are rare, special people. Yet all of us ‚Äútext‚Äù all day, write thousands of messages, and have engaging conversations where we share our life with family and friends. Thus, it‚Äôs something we **all** can do if there is a topic or passion that inspires us.

The story can be very simple. Look at this example:

üìú _A number of years ago I wanted to be able to take a summer trip with my wife and four children. I had a very limited budget and could not afford to put my family up in motels. I decided to rig our station wagon as a camper._

_First I went to the library to get some books on campers. I read those books. Next I designed a plan of what I had to build so that I could outfit the inside of the station wagon as well as topside. Then I went and purchased the necessary wood. On weekends over a period of six weeks I first constructed, in my driveway, the shell for the ‚Äúsecond story‚Äù on my station wagon. Then I cut doors, windows, and placed a six-drawer bureau within that shell. I mounted it on top of the wagon and pinioned it in place by driving two-by-fours under the station wagon‚Äôs rack on top. I then outfitted the inside of the station wagon, back in the wheel-well, with a table and a bench on either side that I made._

_The result was a complete homemade camper which I put together when we were about to start our trip and then disassembled after we got back home. When we went on our summer trip we were able to be on the road for four weeks yet stayed within our budget since we didn‚Äôt have to stay at motels. I estimate I saved $1,900 on motel bills during that summer‚Äôs vacation._

This story, as any other, includes five elements:

1. **Your goal - what you wanted to accomplish:** ‚ÄúI wanted to be able to take a summer trip with my wife and four children.‚Äù
2. **The hurdle, obstacle, or constraint** you faced (self-imposed or otherwise): ‚ÄúI had a very limited budget and could not afford to put my family up in motels.‚Äù
3. **A description of your actions, step by step** (how you set about to ultimately achieve your above goal despite this hurdle or constraint): _‚ÄúI decided to rig our station wagon as a camper. First I went to the library to get some books on campers. I read those books. Next I designed a plan of what I had to build so that I could outfit the inside of the station wagon as well as topside. Then I went and purchased the necessary wood. On weekends over six weeks I‚Ä¶‚Äù etc., etc._
4. **A description of the outcome or result**: ‚ÄúWhen we went on our summer trip we were able to be on the road for four weeks yet stayed within our budget since we didn‚Äôt have to stay at motels.‚Äù\*
5. **Any measurable/quantifiable statement of that outcome** that you can think of: _‚ÄúI estimate I saved $1,900 on motel bills during that summer‚Äôs vacation.‚Äù_

For many of us it might be difficult to find a topic to start writing about and staring at a blank page becomes stressful. If you need help inspiring you, read this article to look at how other people have found their topic.

**Guiding questions:**

- Should I write about professional situations only?
- What kind of moments should I consider for my story?

**Apply what you have learned:**

1. Write your story now in Table A of the [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OCywwNXU4OewPFVaYqOCWBxN4h8O-FuFtVTQjD6Ea3M/edit#heading=h.k1jc0w4sihkw)! It doesn‚Äôt have to be about a huge achievement; describe a situation where you had fun and achieved something! But don‚Äôt be too brief. This isn‚Äôt Twitter!

### Step 2: Analyze your first story to identify the transferable skills you used.

Transferable skills include all sorts of capacities: abilities with people, data, ideas, and other tasks you know how to do. If you analyze your first story, you will find evidence of how you have some of these skills; especially if you use a list of skills as a reference.

**Apply what you have learned:**

1. Write the title of your first story in the first column of Table B.
2. Work your way through the list of skills in the last column of [Parachute Skills Grid](http://content.randomhouse.com/assets/9780399579653/view.php?id=9780399579653a017) and ask yourself if you used any of these skills in this first story.
3. Copy the skills you identify to the column ‚ÄúYour Skills‚Äù in Table B.
4. Add an X under the column ‚ÄúStory 1‚Äù to show that you applied that skill in this story. It will be important for you to know how many times you have used each skill.
5. Continue working through the entire list of skills.

### Step 3: Write at least 4 more stories and analyze the transferable skills

As the saying goes, ‚ÄúA tree doesn‚Äôt make a forest,‚Äù so using a skill once doesn‚Äôt mean you master it. You have finished the first story but need more examples of your abilities. According to the author of this exercise, Nelson, you need to write 5 stories at least and the ideal number is 7. Once you finish you will look for patterns: skills that appear several times. They do so because they are your favorites (if you wrote about situations you enjoyed) and they are abilities that distinguish you.

**Apply what you have learned:**

1. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until you complete 5 - 7 stories.

# Step 1: Select the jobs to apply for

## Learning objectives

- Identify 5 places you can search for remote jobs online.
- Select fitting jobs to apply to from a list of available positions.
- Describe the importance of using tools like Huntr to track your job search.

### **Estimated time**: 1.5h

## Description

In this exercise you will look for current job openings, identify those that are fit for you, and select at least one that you want to apply to.

### Why is it important to select the jobs you apply for?

Sending bulk job applications might often be the best way to find a job quickly, but it is not always so. As a job searcher you face the “quantity” versus “quality” dilemma: which jobs should you apply for? How much effort to invest in each job application?

To make an informed decision you must:

1. Identify the job opportunities “out there” and
2. Analyze which ones are the best options for YOU. This means considering at the same time:
   - How your knowledge, skills, and personal attributes are a good fit for the role, and
   - How that specific position helps you move ahead in your professional career.

Ideally a job should help you move forward toward your goals. So when you find a job opportunity that does, it’s worth it to work very carefully in each step of the job application process. But it’s also a good idea to send job applications to other openings to increase your chances of getting a job soon without spending so much time customizing your application materials. It's a balancing act.

## Exercise

### Instructions

This first step consists of three different activities:

1. Finding online jobs to apply for,
2. Analyzing if they are a good fit for you, and
3. Adding the job listings to your Huntr board

The following instructions offer you guidance for each of them.

### 1.1 Finding online jobs to apply for

You have many options for finding job opportunities: you can search online on websites that publish listings, get referrals from your professional or personal network, or find those hidden jobs (those that are not yet available). For this exercise, you will use the first resource, because it is one that you can access every day.

**Refresh your knowledge about resources for finding jobs**

Many websites list job openings and specialize in certain types of jobs. Try different ones and identify those that match your interests and needs. In the article below you will find an extensive list of websites you can visit to find jobs.

- [Where do I find jobs to apply to?](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/where-do-I-find-jobs-to-apply-to.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Use one of these resources to find the job positions you would like to apply for.

### 1.2 Analyzing if they are a good fit for you

Not all job postings are created equal! Some might be a better fit than others. Therefore before sending a job application it’s essential to analyze the description and decide if it is a good fit for you.

Read the following article to refresh your memory on the information that will help you make this decision:

- [Pointers to consider when searching for a good-fitting job](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/pointers-to-consider-when-searching-for-a-good-fitting-job.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Read the description of the job openings you found in the step above carefully and look for the pointers described in the article. Register your findings in Section 1, Table A of [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bz0Ute5_3onmFAM-coVFM7zRX4MoC-XZwq6xRSGN2E4/edit?usp=sharing).
2. In the last two rows of the table, decide if it’s worth applying to the job and how much time and effort you will invest in customizing your application materials.

### 1.3. Creating your wishlist in your Huntr board

The two tricks to efficient job searching are consistency and retrospection. First you need to apply to a consistent amount of jobs every week and you need to be able to track the status of each job you apply to. Then over time you need to see how many jobs you applied to, at which stage of the hiring process you dropped off, and how you can improve bit by bit to get to your final offer.

This is where Huntr comes in to help you. Huntr is an online platform that helps you stay consistent with your job search and allows you to retrospect carefully on every phase of your job search so that you can see what is working for you, what is not, and make improvements.

In Huntr boards you can register the jobs you find, create a “wishlist” of those you want to apply for, identify those you have “applied for,” and then move them if you get invited to interviews.

**Apply what you've learned**

1. If you haven’t created a Huntr account yet, [click here to sign up for Huntr and create your board.](https://huntr.co/microverse/signup)
2. Using the information from Table A, select at least one job application you want to apply for in this module, but not more than 3. Since you are learning the process, it’s important to take some time to study the best practices for each step and that requires time. If you decide that none of the job postings you have analyzed are worth it, go back to 1.1 and look for another job opening.
3. Add the job listing you selected in the previous step to your Huntr board. The easiest way to do this is using the [Huntr Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/huntr-job-search-tracker/mihdfbecejheednfigjpdacgeilhlmnf?hl=en). You can also add it manually. Refer to the [Quickstart guide](https://blog.huntr.co/huntr-quickstart-guide/#:~:text=Add%20jobs%20from%20any%20website,save%20and%20you're%20done!) if necessary.

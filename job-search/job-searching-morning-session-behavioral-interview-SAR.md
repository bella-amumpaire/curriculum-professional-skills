# Peer-to-peer interview practice: Behavioral interviews with the SAR framework

## Learning objectives

- Answer behavioral questions using the SAR framework.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise

### Instructions

💡 **Remember that this meeting should take 1 hour, not 30 minutes.**

- Join the Zoom call with your team - remember to always be on time to respect your teammates’ time and practice respecting your interviewers’ time.
- Select a **leader** who will ensure you follow the outline below - do not skip any steps!

### Preparation - 15 min

1. In a big group, read the following information to refresh your understanding of using the SAR framework to answer behavioral questions.
    - Mute your microphones and read in silence.

**Why is structuring your answers to behavioral interview questions important?**

To get to know you better and assess if you are culturally fit for the company, recruiters will ask you to describe past experiences related to issues that are important for the role that you are applying for. For example, they can ask how you have dealt with conflict or communicated in interdisciplinary teams or multicultural environments. Typically, these questions begin with “Tell me about…”.

The SAR (situation-action-result) framework you studied during the core program helps you structure your answers to these questions to communicate effectively. In addition, practicing how to use it to show different attributes of your personality and give evidence of your professional performance in the past will help you prepare for actual interviews.

**Refresh your memory on how to structure each element of your answers.**

- [How to frame and share results effectively](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/how-to-frame-and-share-results-effectively.md)

2. Once everybody is ready, make a collective summary of the attributes that each element of the answer should have.  

### Interviewers setup - 5 min

1. Everybody will be an interviewer during the exercise, so each of you must follow the steps below:
    - Open [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pJ8BIhi39iYl6k498xqdAR_TfZhotunao2CTqF6L6Rs/edit#gid=2041017957) and get a list of randomly generated behavioral questions.
    - Select two questions to ask your partner about a past situation (with the format Tell me about).     
    - Reflect upon the attribute that the question will help you identify in the interviewee, such as initiative, empathy, compassion, humility, and teamwork. Then, consider possible follow-up questions to dig deeper into that attribute during the interview.
    - Open the [following checklist for providing feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16-ksqgYN4KX21DEfk46zib5OY8KnDOYRtPPviLGtes8/edit#heading=h.za7e1fwup8u). Copy the two questions you will be asking at the top of each section and register the attribute they will help you identify. 
    - Read the criteria and indicators that you will assess in the interview.

2. Split yourselves into groups of 2 and go into breakout rooms as you did [in this exercise](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/job-searching-morning-session-using-breakout-rooms-for-interview-practice.md#what-are-breakout-rooms).
    - **Set timer for breakout rooms - it should be 25 minutes.**
    - If there is an odd number of people in your group, one room will need to have 3 people.

### Quick interviews - 25 min

1. In your breakout rooms, you will take turns.
    - Each of you will play the role of an interviewer once and the role of an applicant once.

2. In each interview, the interviewer will ask 2 behavioral questions following these steps:
    - The interviewer opens the [following checklist for giving advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16-ksqgYN4KX21DEfk46zib5OY8KnDOYRtPPviLGtes8/edit#heading=h.za7e1fwup8u). **You should fill it in during the interview if possible.**
    - The interviewer starts [timer (**3 minutes**)](https://vclock.com/timer/#countdown=00:03:00&enabled=0&seconds=180&title=Peer+interviews+practice&sound=xylophone&loop=1).
    - The interviewer asks the first question.
    - **The applicant answers using the SAR framework.**
    - The interviewer indicates when the time is up.
    - The interviewer asks a follow-up question to dig deeper into the attribute they wish to explore and gives the applicant an additional minute to answer.
    - The interviewer starts [timer (**1 minutes**)](https://vclock.com/timer/#countdown=00:01:00&enabled=0&seconds=60&title=Peer+interviews+practice&sound=xylophone&loop=1).
    - The applicant answers the follow-up question.
    - The interviewer shares with the applicant the attribute(s) identified in the answer given and explains why (if possible, give concrete examples). (1 minute)

**Do not extend the allocated time as it is important that you practice completing tasks on time, as you will need to in your real interviews.**

3. When all interviews are finished:
     - All interviewers finish filling the checklist in.
     - All interviewers share a filled-in rubric with the applicant. **The applicant will use this for their exercise submission**.

### Recap with the big group - 10 min

1. Come back to the main room in Zoom.
2. Use [this Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrclyLFtL6b5fMdT) form for a self-reflecion and rating for the interviewer.
3. Share something you will work on based on one piece of feedback with the entire group.

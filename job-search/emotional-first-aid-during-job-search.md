# Emotional first aid during job searching

## Learning objectives

- Identify the screening stages in the recruitment process

### Estimated time: 0.25h

## Description

In this lesson, you will reflect upon the relevance of emotional first aid and identify strategies to protect yourself from the negative impact of being rejected several times during the job searching process.

### Why is it important?

Rejection is inevitable when you job search. There will always be more applicants than job openings, and most people must apply to many jobs before finding one that is a good match for them. However, if we implement strategies to take care of our emotions as we job search, we can avoid the negative impact on our self-esteem from repeated rejections.

### So, what can we do?

Guy Winch has coined the term “emotional first aid” to describe intentional actions to take care of our brain. Watch this video to familiarize yourself with this concept and identify how you can  deal with frustration.

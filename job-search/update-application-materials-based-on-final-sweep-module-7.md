# Update your application materials based on "final sweep" feedback

## Learning objectives:

- Review all your job application materials and highlight anything that is out of date.

### **Estimated time**: 2 hrs

## What is the final sweep?

To start you job search as well prepared as possible, you have updated your application projects and submitted them to your career coach. By now, you should have received feedback from your coach through the Student Dashboard. If you haven't done so already, take some time now to make changes based on your coach's comments. 

**NOTE** - If you have not received feedback yet, please reach out to your coach and let them know, so they can send it as soon as possible. 

### Why is the final sweep important?

As we mentioned before, you want to do everything you can to improve your chances of landing your dream job. So our coaches work to ensure that your application materials are as good as they can be, so you don't get removed from an interview process for a preventable reason like a type or a poorly worded sentence. 

### Review your feedback and make changes

Now that you've gotten feedback from your coach, make sure to read through it carefully and make changes to your projects. This feedback will be on your Student Dashboard but also in the form of comments on your Google Doc submissions, so be sure to look in both places. 

- [Remind yourself about the final sweep submission guidelines](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/final-sweep.md)

After you finish making changes to your application materials, submit the Google Doc with the links to all of your application materials.

**Please verify that you have tended to all of your coach's comments and the links open the updated version of the documents.**

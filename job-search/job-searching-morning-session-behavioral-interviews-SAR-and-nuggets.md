# Peer-to-peer interview practice: Adding nuggets to your SAR answers

## Learning objectives

- Answer common behavioral questions in the SAR format.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise

During this morning session, you will practice with one of your peers using adding ‚Äúnuggets‚Äù to your answers to behavioral interview questions structured with the SAR framework.

### Instructions

üí° **Remember that this meeting should take 1 hour, not 30 minutes.**

- Join the Zoom call with your team - remember to always be on time to respect your teammates‚Äô time and practice respecting your interviewers‚Äô time.
- Select a **leader** who will ensure you follow the outline below - do not skip any steps!

### Preparation - 15 min

1. In a big group, read the section ‚ÄúGive structured answers‚Äù on page 34 of [Chapter 5. Cracking the Coding Interview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hQZzkNB4NeJ2vejNeqjUsy9ISnDsf98U/view).
   - Mute your microphones and read in silence.
   - Once you have finished, make sure everybody understands what ‚Äúnuggets‚Äù are in the context of behavioral interviews.

### Interviewers setup - 5 min

1. Everybody will be an interviewer during the exercise, so each of you must follow the steps below:

   - Open [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pJ8BIhi39iYl6k498xqdAR_TfZhotunao2CTqF6L6Rs/edit#gid=2041017957) and get a list of randomly generated behavioral questions.
   - Select two questions to ask your partner about a past situation (with the format "Tell me about").
   - Reflect upon the attribute that the question will help you identify in the interviewee, such as initiative, empathy, compassion, humility, and teamwork?
   - Open the [following checklist for providing feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DrJNDzPpm_HCF9dyLOfmqxErlliP3ItiTpx3Wd8Bif8/edit#heading=h.za7e1fwup8u). Copy the two questions that you will be asking at the top of each section and register the attribute that they will help you identify.
   - Read the criteria and indicators that you will assess in the interview.

2. Split yourselves into groups of 2 and go into breakout rooms as you did [in this exercise](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/job-searching-morning-session-using-breakout-rooms-for-interview-practice.md#what-are-breakout-rooms).
   - **Set timer for breakout rooms - it should be 25 minutes.**
   - If there is an odd number of people in your group, one room will need to have 3 people.

### Prepared interviews - 25 min

1. In your breakout rooms, you will take turns.

   - Each of you will play the role of an interviewer once and the role of an applicant once.

2. To prepare the answers, both interviewers will read aloud the two questions they will ask their peers.

3. Spend 5 minutes preparing each question's nugget and sketching the situation, action, and result. Use this [worksheet](‚Äã‚Äãhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wn_ZC7v_z6L29VPgQDXl_zroKC3XHKWbwYlmi2ktlgo/edit#) to register your ideas.

4. Take turns doing the interviews. In each one, the interviewer will ask 2 behavioral questions following these steps:
   - The interviewer opens the [following checklist for giving advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DrJNDzPpm_HCF9dyLOfmqxErlliP3ItiTpx3Wd8Bif8/edit#heading=h.za7e1fwup8u). **You should fill it in during the interview if possible.**
   - The interviewer set the [timer](https://vclock.com/timer/#countdown=00:03:00&date=2022-06-24T17:11:04&sound=xylophone&loop=1) to 3 min.
   - The interviewer asks the first question.
   - **The applicant answers beginning with a nugget and using the SAR framework.**
   - The interviewer indicates when the time is up.
   - The interviewer shares with the applicant if the nugget summarized what they talked about and explains the attribute(s) identified in the answer and why (if possible, give concrete examples) (1 min).

**Do not extend the allocated time as it is important you practice completing tasks on time, as you will need to in your actual interviews.**

5. When you finish all interviews:
   - All interviewers complete the checklist.
   - All interviewers share a filled-in checklist with the applicant. **The applicant will use this for their exercise submission**.

### Recap with the big group - 10 min

1. Come back to the main room in Zoom.
2. Use [this Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrclyLFtL6b5fMdT) form for a self-assessment and rating for the interviewer.
3. Share something you will work on based on one piece of feedback with the entire group.

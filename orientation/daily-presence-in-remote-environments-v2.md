## Description

Your life in the Microverse program mimics the daily routines of a remote job where you belong to virtual community whose members interact in an online space instead of a physical one. In this context, “being present” involves: 

- following your daily schedule and joining the required virtual meetings on time, that is attendance, and
- actively participating in learning activities during sessions, which is engagement.

This lesson talks about the importance of attendance and engagement as components of daily presence and describes the policy and expectations about each aspect at Microverse.

### Why is attendance important?

Working and learning daily allows you to build knowledge consistently and helps you gain momentum. Following a rigorous schedule will allow you to build some of the most important skills to be a successful professional: reliability, accountability, and punctuality.

### Why is engagement during meetings important?

Collaborative learning is essential in the Microverse program to deepen your knowledge and skills by teaching others and being taught by them. Thus, we expect you to communicate and collaborate effectively with peers during your daily meetings. So, besides attending sessions on time, we require you to: 
- participate in the learning tasks we have designed,
- turn on your camera to connect with others and show them you are listening, and
- turn on your microphone to express your ideas verbally.

Remember that it's harder to relate with others when you are not together in the same room. Sharing your video and opening your microphones to talk with your peers demonstrates your investment in the activities and contributes to developing mutual trust. 

Initially, you may feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed talking to strangers, and showing yourself or your environment to others. With practice and mastering some tips for effective camera and microphone usage, you will build confidence and become skillful at communicating online.

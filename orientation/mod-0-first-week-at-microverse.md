# First week at Microverse in the Intro to Remote Web Development Course

### What is Orientation day?

It’s your first day at Microverse, your Orientation Day. Today you will learn all the things that you will need to succeed at the Microverse: tools, support network, daily activities, and program expectations. Let’s start learning together!

After today:

- You will understand the main tools you will need in the program and meet your first coding partners.
- You will understand the Microverse learning model and the principles under which it was designed.
- You will understand the daily activities and rituals you will be doing in the course.
- You will understand the Code of Conduct and policies (attendance, deadlines, and plagiarism) that we will apply during the course to create a supportive and safe learning environment for everyone.
- You will meet your standup team, a group of students that will meet with each day along your Microverse journey. This group will change weekly during the first module at Microverse.

### What will you learn during your first week at Microverse?

By the end of this week:

- You will have basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
- You will learn git and GitHub.
- You will understand the deadlines in the Course.
- You will build projects you're proud of!

### What does collaboration look like during your first week at Microverse?

During Day 1, you will have different partners during the day. In the first half of the day (until lunch time) you will work with 1-2 learning partners on orientation activities. Then, when you return from the lunch break, you will have a new partner. With each partner, you may choose to work together for the entire collaboration session, but the minimum requirement is 10 minutes during the morning collaboration session and 10 minutes in the afternoon collaboration session, and all collaborative projects should be done together.

This is different from rest of the week, when you will have the same partner and collaborate together day after day. Starting on Day 2 of the course you'll have 1-2 partners you'll keep for the rest of the week.

If you do not hear back from your learning partner or your partner isn't following the collaboration requirements, please reach out to Student Success right away so we can help figure out what is going on. 

For onboarding, you will work together with your partner once you've linked your Zoom Account to your dashboard. (more on that later!)

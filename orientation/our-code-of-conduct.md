## Description

This lesson explains what our code of conduct is at Microverse and how to report any harassment you experience.

### Why is the code of conduct important?

Like at any workplace or school, we expect our students to be professional at all times in what they do and in what they say. This is even more important in our international remote setting where it is even easier for things to be lost in translation. We all make honest mistakes, but we should also always strive to avoid them. We can do that by following the student code of conduct.

### Code of Conduct

The code of conduct includes a set of behavior expectations to create a positive learning experience.

Guiding questions:

- How can you contribute to a positive learning environment?
- Why is attendance such an important part of the Microverse learning experience?
- What does it mean to have a harassment-free learning space?

# Meet your first learning partner

## Learning objectives

- Recognize the importance of investing in good working relationships with teammates.
- Understand how to make working agreements with new teammates.

### **Estimated time**: .75h

## Description

In this activity you will get to know your learning partner(s), familiarize yourself with the check-in calls you will have with them, and set working agreements for the week.

❗️ Connect with your partner(s) in a Zoom call through your student dashboard before starting this activity.

### How to connect with your first learning partner(s)

You should have already received a message introducing you to your partner(s). Earlier today, you connected your Zoom account to Microverse, so you should now see a link to your partner(s) in your Student Dashboard. Send your partner(s) a message on Slack if they aren't in the Zoom call when you join. If you can't find your partner, contact Student Success before moving forward.

### Why should you spend time getting to know your learning partner(s)?

You're in a remote program that is a community. Your first learning partner(s) may later become your pair programming partners or be in your standup team. Each time you work with a new person at Microverse, you have a chance to build your network. More importantly, teamwork happens with people and getting to know one another as human beings is the foundation of working together successfully.

### Get to know each other [10 min]

Relationships begin with curiosity about other people. They start with sharing a little about yourself and showing interest in your partner(s). Use the following questions to spend some time getting to know each other.

- [Questions to get to know your first learning partner(s)](/orientation/questions-to-get-to-know-your-first-learning-partner.md)

### Check-in calls with your teammate(s) [10 min]

Each day, you are expected to have a call with your assigned partner(s) during the morning and afternoon Program Time sessions in your schedule. You are probably wondering now: what will you do in check-in calls? Read together with your partner(s) the following articles to learn more about check-in calls.

Consider these guiding questions:

- What types of check-in calls will you have during the program? What will you do with your partner(s) in each one?
- How will you know what to say?

We suggest you bookmark the second link, “Team call check-in guide” for easy reference during your calls!

### Learn about working agreements [5 min]

This week, you'll be meeting twice daily with your learning partner(s). You won't be collaborating on projects, but you will be joining calls to check in with each other. Setting working agreements with teammates you'll be interacting with every day will help you stay coordinated and work more smoothly together.

Guiding questions:

- What are working agreements?
- Why is it useful for new teams to make working agreements?

Watch the following video together to learn more about working agreements, and consider the guiding questions while you watch.

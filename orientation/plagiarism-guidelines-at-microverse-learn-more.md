# Anti-plagiarism guidelines at Microverse

Plagiarism in programming is defined as _copying someone else's source and claiming it as your own_. Plagiarism is **not allowed**, as all our assignments are designed to test and advance your skills. 

We encourage you to write original code and work on improving your skills on a daily basis. By simply copy-pasting the work of others, this is not possible.

## üìñ Guidelines

Microverse encourages you to use various sources to find solutions to your problems. However, in order to help you avoid cases of plagiarism in the Program, you can take advantage of the following anti-plagiarism guidelines to improve your learning!

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Learn from others‚Äô code by thinking about it (not copying). Then create your own solutions that fit your codebase and style**

- Look at others' work and ask yourself: What‚Äôs going on? What concepts are relevant? What problem is being solved?
- Only when you understand it are you making use of others' work effectively
- Create your own solutions that fit your codebase and style

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Break a problem up into smaller pieces. Try understand and solve each individually. (also called the Divide and Conquer strategy)**

- Break a problem up into smaller components and try to solve separately
- Googling for a complete solution leads to more question. While Googling for smaller questions leads to better results.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Try to reproduce some else‚Äôs solution in a new project. This way you can learn more about their process of solving the problem.**

- Sometimes there's a valid reason for reusing others' work (i.e. libraries, frameworks)
- Try out reused code in isolation in order to understand what problem it tries to solve
- When reusing someone else's code (i.e. a peer) give credit!

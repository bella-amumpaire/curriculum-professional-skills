# Meet the Partner(s) You'll Have for the Rest of the Week and Set Working Agreements Together

## Learning objectives

- Recognize the importance of investing in good working relationships with teammates.
- Understand how to make working agreements with new teammates.

### **Estimated time**: .5h

## Description

By now you should be familiar with the process of meeting new partners and setting agreements for how you'll work together. The goal of this activity is to put this into practice again with the partner(s) you'll have for the rest of the week.

### Get to know each other

You'll do this every time you meet a new person in the program. Share about yourself, learn your partner's name, and show interest in who they are.

You can use your own questions. Or, you can use the following questions to talk with your new partners and get to know each other for 5 minutes.

### Set working agreements

You'll be building projects with your partner(s) for the rest of the week, so you should set agreeements first. Having a good foundation of communication helps you work well together and avoid common problems.

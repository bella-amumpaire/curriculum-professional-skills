# Meet your first Learning Partner (Intro Course)

## Learning objectives

- Recognize the importance of investing in good working relationships with teammates.

### **Estimated time**: .25h

## Description

The goal of this activity is to get to know your first learning partner(s). Connect with your partner(s) in a Zoom call through your student dashboard before starting this activity.

### How to connect with your first learning partner(s)

You should have already received a message introducing you to your partner(s). Earlier today, you connected your Zoom account to Microverse, so you should now see a link to your partner(s) in your Student Dashboard. Send your partner(s) a message on Slack if they aren't in the Zoom call when you join. If you can't find your partner, contact Student Success before moving forward.

### Why should you spend time getting to know your learning partner(s)?

You're in a remote program that is a community. Your first learning partner(s) may later become your pair programming partners or be in your standup team. Each time you work with a new person at Microverse, you have a chance to build your network. More importantly, teamwork happens with people and getting to know one another as human beings is the foundation of working together successfully.

### Get to know each other

Relationships begin with curiosity about other people. They start with sharing a little about yourself and showing interest in your partner(s).

Use the following questions to spend 10 minutes talking with your new partners and getting to know each other.

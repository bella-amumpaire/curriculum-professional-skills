# Tools: Get Familiar with Slack (Intro Course)

### Learning objectives

- Demonstrates ability to navigate and communicate using Slack.

### Estimated time: 0.25h

## Description

This lesson helps you get familiar with using Slack to communicate with your partners and reach out to other Micronauts.

### Why is getting familiar with Slack important?

Slack will be the main tool used to communicate with your peers at Microverse. Slack allows you to be part of and interact with a community via the #full-time Channel and your group chat with your standup team, among others. Slack also allows you to get help when you have any (non-technical) questions. Microverse staff will post announcements on Slack, but any other communication with Microverse staff will be on Zendesk, not in Slack.

### Getting to know your peers

In the following article you will learn more about who you will reach out to and the different channels you can use on Slack:

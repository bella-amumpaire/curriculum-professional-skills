# A tour of your Student Dashboard

In this section, you will have a tour of your Student Dashboard. This will likely feel a little overwhelming as it's a lot of information. That's okay! It will become more clear as you spend more time working on the Dashboard. Pay close attention to the videos. Take notes if that helps you remember better and stop to clarify anything if needed. 

Please only continue with this section after you've finished the previous sections: "Log in to your Student Dashboard" and "Connect your Zoom". 

### Introduction to the dashboard

**Important highlights from the video:** 

- The green dot highlights which session is currently taking place.
- You should always join Zoom calls through the "Join call" button on the main dashboard page.
- The Program hours you see are the UTC+1 or UTC-6 hours, not your local hours.
- You can see your progress in the Program, as well as the modules and blocks you have repeated, in the homepage.
- Your progress in the current block appears in the Progress View page.
- You can check your attendance and engagement in the corresponding page.
- If you need to be absent once, inform your teammates. You don't need to report a short absence to MV, only long ones.
- The technical questions menu option takes you to Discourse, where you can get technical help.
- The FAQs and announcements takes you to Zendesk, where you can look for answers to non-technical questions.

**Important highlights from the video:**

- You'll find here the activities for your current week.
- You can also see activities for previous and next weeks in the module, but you won't be able to work on future ones.
- You have to complete all core requirement activities as well as any activity that you have carried over by Saturday 11:59. 
- You may skip one skippable activity per block and you may carry over up to 5 carry-over activities to the following week.
- You can view the activities by clicking on the link.
- Technical projects always require you to submit a "Project completion form" to be completed. Failure to submit it will result in a repeat week.
- Check-point quizzes will require a score of 70% to pass the week. You have three attempts to achieve this score.

**Additional details about activities and submissions**

- You can undo submissions and submit again lessons, exercises, feedback forms, and projects.
- Group projects (learning partner, standup team, and morning session team) will be done together but submitted individually (this means each student has to submit the link to the group product, usually a Google Doc). All members of the team can submit the same link.
- Pair-programming activities will be done together and submitted together (this means only one person will have to submit).
- "Test your knowledge quizzes" are designed as self-assessments; they help you identify any content that you haven't mastered and there is not a required score for them.
- Feedback forms can take up to one hour before the status changes to "completed".

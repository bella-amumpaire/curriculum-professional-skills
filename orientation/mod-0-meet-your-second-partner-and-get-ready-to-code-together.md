# Meet your Second Learning Partner and Get Ready to Code Together

## üõë‚è∞ What time is it?
NOTE: This activity takes places AFTER the midday break. You should not do this activity before 1pm UTC+1 as the system needs to first assign you a NEW partner. You will NOT see a new partner if you do this activity before 12pm UTC+1. If you're done with all your morning activities including Review Your Learning Partner(s) from the morning, go ahead and take a break now until 1pm UTC+1 and then continue on with your learning activities. 

## Learning objectives

- Recognize the importance of investing in good working relationships with teammates.
- Understand how to make working agreements with new teammates.

### **Estimated time**: .5h

## Description

For the second half of your day, you have a different partner. You will be completing a few more orientation activities, and beginning to code together. The goal of this activity is to get to know your new learning partner(s) and set working agreements with them. Remember to connect with your partner(s) in a Zoom call through your student dashboard before starting this activity.

### Why should you spend time getting to know each partner you have?

Each person you meet could be a new friend, someone you end up working with a lot, or the person who helps you get your first job! Treat every partner like a valuable person and spend time getting to know them. 

### Get to know each other

You'll do this every time you meet a new person in the program. Share about yourself, learn your partner's name, and show interest in who they are.

You can use the following questions to talk with your new partners and get to know each other for 5 minutes.

### Learn about working agreements

Starting with this partner, you'll be doing pair programming so you need to set agreements together about how you will work. Setting working agreements with teammates you'll be working closely with will help you stay coordinated and work more smoothly together this week.

Guiding questions:

- What are working agreements?
- Why is it useful for new teams to make working agreements?

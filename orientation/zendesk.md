# Zendesk
**Zendesk** is a powerful help center tool that helps Microverse Staff communicate with our students on a daily basis. We use it when we need to speak to you and you will use it when you need to speak to us. As well as being our main communication tool, Zendesk is also where you will find answers to any questions you have about the program. We have a lot of Frequently Asked Questions, or FAQs in Zendesk with a list of questions that many students before you have had. For example, if you aren't sure what to do in your Stand up Team meetings you can find your answer in Zendesk.

Much of the information you will need during onboarding lives in Zendesk so it's important that you get access to Zendesk now.

Please go ahead and log in to Zendesk using Google SSO: [https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us)

Please bookmark the Zendesk page once you have access to it so you can easily access the FAQs.

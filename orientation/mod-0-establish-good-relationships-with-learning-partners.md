# Meet your New Learning Partner(s)

## Learning objectives

- Recognize the importance of investing in good working relationships with teammates.
- Understand how to make working agreements with new teammates.

### **Estimated time**: .5h

## Description

Practicing how you meet new people and agree to work together is very important in remote work. You need to get in the habit of treating each partner as a teammate in your learning journey, and practice for the day when you'll be meeting new coworkers all the time.

### Get to know your latest partner and decide how you will work together

By now you might start to have your own routines for getting to know others at Microverse. But you may still feel really shy and find it hard to talk with new people. 

We suggest bookmarking the following questions as a way of remembering how to start conversations with strangers:

- [Questions to get to know your first learning partner(s)](questions-to-get-to-know-your-first-learning-partner.md)

Now spend some time chatting with your newest partner. Your work together this week will be more individual, but it's important still to make agreements with your partner to decide when you'll talk each day and how you'll support each other as learning partners.

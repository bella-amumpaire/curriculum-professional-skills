### **Estimated time**: 0.5h

## Problem solving as a developer

In this activity, you will learn about problem-solving as a developer, and then share with each other your experiences of problem-solving this week and consider where you can make improvements.

### Why is this important?

A foundational skill for developers is learning to break problems down and solve them by tackling one part at a time. At Microverse, we have a lot of activities where you talk with your partners and teammates, and explain your thinking. This is because we want you practicing problem-solving together. When you work in a team as a developer, you will be called on to solve problems. Those who become successful are those who learn key problem-solving skills and know how to talk about them.  

### Tips on problem-solving as a developer.

When you're new to coding, it helps to hear from those more experienced, especially when it comes to problem-solving. Here, we share a video with tips on problem-solving as a developer.

**Guiding questions:**

- What problems did you face this week that could be helped by the techniques in the video?
- Which strategy is most important when you're new to coding, according to the video?

Watch the video together: [How to think like a programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiYXwUg23Yw).

# Using Kanban boards to guide meetings

Doing a daily standup or project updates using the Kanban board is very similar to doing the daily standup without Kanban boards. You may choose to give updates to your team during meetings using the Kanban board this week. This is optional. It's good practice as you will likely do this later in your software development job. 

When you start the meeting assign a team leader who will facilitate the discussion. The leader will coordinate the discussion, assign turns, ensure the group stays on topic, and finish the meeting on time. They can also share their screen to show the Kanban board while each team member gives an update on the tasks they are working on, using the Kanban cards as a reference.

On the first day, talk about your priorities for the week based on the Kanban task cards that you have received. Talk briefly about each task or, if you have plenty of tasks, define the biggest priorities to discuss. 

For other days, give short updates on the tasks that you have "In Progress" that day. Talk briefly about which cards you completed and how the work went. Also, tell others about the cards that you plan to start next and what steps you will take for those. Discuss any blockers for any of the tasks that are either in "This Sprint", "In Progress", or "In Review".

At the end of the update, make sure to discuss possible next steps to address the blockers of any teammates.

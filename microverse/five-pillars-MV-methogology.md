# The five pillars in the Microverse methodology

As a fully remote program, we are pretty unique in that we don't have classrooms or teachers. That's because we know that our highly driven students don't need these things as long as they have the motivation and commitment to learning every day. Below we describe the five pillars of our program that make it possible.

### Collaboration

If there is one word that defines Microverse, it is "collaboration." We believe that collaboration skills are extremely important to become a successful learner, team player, and, ultimately, a great software developer.
The real-time collaborative experience we have designed is meant to help you feel supported at all times during your learning journey. You will collaborate with other students, other programmers (e.g. in open-source projects), and most of all, you will collaborate with your coding partner.
Having a coding partner helps you stay consistently focused on your learning, move faster through the material, and get stuck or frustrated less often. What's more, collaborative learning gives you the chance to practice pair programming, improve your spoken English, and develop your teamwork abilities.

### Proactiveness

At Microverse, we do not have teachers. We believe in the [Socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method) and we think that our role is to guide you to be able to find your answers. That means that you should NOT expect us to lecture you or to directly answer all your questions. Even though we will try to always be available for you, we expect that you will not wait for our reply, but rather will go forward in finding a way to the solution. That being said, as we mentioned previously, you will have a great support structure in place to help you when you are stuck and to review your code and everything you work on.

### Curation

For the past 10 years, organizations and individuals from all around the world have started doing something amazing, they have created some of the best learning content in the world and they have made it available online to everyone. 

Microverse's role is not to continue adding to this pile of great content, but rather to design a fun, supportive, and holistic experience on top of the existing content using an innovative financial structure that gives more people access to a world-class education.

For the Software Development Program, we have personally evaluated over 100 different programs, courses, platforms, and curriculums and we have chosen the content that we think is the most appropriate to help you in your learning journey.

For the most part, we will use The Odin Project, a curriculum that is highly aligned with our learning methodology. The Odin Project is incredibly rich, it is open source (so you can contribute to it) and it follows a project-based learning approach (we will talk about that in a moment). Additionally, we will use other sources of content such as freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, as well as tools such as Learneroo and Exercism.io to complement your learning. 

### Project-Based Learning

Adults tend to learn most effectively and efficiently by doing, and in the case of software development, this means building things. You have probably already figured out that it is impossible to learn to code without actually coding.
The curriculum and materials we have curated are all focused on getting your hands dirty, working on real-world projects and coding challenges. By the end of the program, you should have spent at least 800 hours of coding and building things.

### Mastery Learning

Last, but not least, let's talk about mastery learning. Until now, schools, universities, and boot camps all tend to work the same way- students (usually of the same age) join a class and since they all move at the same pace, some eventually get bored because the course is not moving fast enough, and others fall behind because the teachers are moving too fast.

At Microverse we use what is known as mastery learning, which means that no one is supposed to move to the next step unless that person has achieved a perfect understanding of a given concept. 

You will work with your coding partner on 30+ different projects during the program, and every project and challenge will have a learning part with tons of reading material to get you ready for the collaboration time. 

We want you to take all the time you need to understand everything, and we want you to feel comfortable asking your coding partner for time to process things. If you do not understand a subject, please say so. If you need more time with a lesson, mention it to your partner. Just make sure that you never feel rushed to move forward or leave any un-mastered concepts behind.

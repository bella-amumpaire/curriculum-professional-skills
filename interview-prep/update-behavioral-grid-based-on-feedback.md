# Update behavioral grid based on feedback

## Learning objectives

- Answer common behavioral questions in the SAR format.

### **Estimated time**: 2h

## Description

In this project, you will be updating your behavioral grid after receiving feedback from your coach.

### Why is updating your behavioral grid important?

Your behavioral grid has been designed to help you showcase your best skills, both technical and interpersonal, so that you can be prepared for any behavioral interview with recruiters, present yourself in your best light, and leave a good impression so that the recruiter wants to hire you. Using the curriculum, you've created a grid that will highlight many of your strengths. It might be difficult to create a perfect grid on your first try, though, so we'll now be using the constructive critique and feedback given to you by your coaches to locate errors and areas of improvement.

This step of the behavioral grid review process will further refine and polish your grid so that you'll have the best chance possible of impressing the hiring managers or recruiters you are interviewing with.

### Project Setup

1. Open up your behavioral grid in Google Docs.
2. Open the written and numerical feedback from your coach, including any feedback they may have written directly in the Google Doc.

### Using coach feedback to improve your behavioral grid

We've repeatedly discussed the importance and value of good feedback, and you should now recognize how necessary feedback is to the revision process. Just as your code will periodically undergo code reviews and quality control as a software developer, your professional skills projects like your behavioral grid, will also undergo reviews. You will now be expected to use this feedback to identify areas of improvement in your behavioral grid.

Please review the helpful tips below to ensure that you gain the most value from the feedback you receive and that you're able to implement the feedback efficiently and correctly.

## Project Submission

### Project Requirements

- Make sure that you have addressed each piece of feedback your coach has given you. If you skip over too much feedback, your coach may return the project to you to re-work on and resubmit again.
- [Make sure that your behavioral grid meets every requirement of the rubric linked here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EARx6VfxiAbqqUrX9FGOFUmw4Rvy1YTQSBMyYJNrHzY/edit?usp=sharing) If you have followed the [behavioral grid curriculum](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/create-your-behavioral-grid.md), it should do so automatically.

### Submission Instructions

_Check out this FAQ if you need a refresher on [Google Doc submission best practices](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063156813)_

1. Carefully review **all feedback** given to you by your coach, including comments and suggestions written directly on the Google Doc.
2. Implement **each piece of feedback**, ensuring that you have not accidentally skipped over anything. If you skip over a piece of feedback on purpose, include an explanation in the submissions form below or leave a comment to your coach directly in the grid document explaining why you skipped over that feedback.
3. Run your document through a spellcheck and grammar check tool like Grammarly before you submit it, even if you did so previously; it is very common to accidentally introduce new errors when making changes to a piece of text.

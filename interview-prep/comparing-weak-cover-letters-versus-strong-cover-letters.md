# Comparing weak cover letters versus strong cover letters (a video lesson)

Writing a cover letter is one of the most difficult and time-consuming parts of the job application process, but it’s also a great way to distinguish yourself among a field of other applicants.

The goal of a cover letter is twofold: **to show not only why you’d be a good fit for this specific job, but also why your personality would be a good fit for this specific team**. Your cover letter shouldn’t just be a rephrasing of your resume; it should tell the story of how your skillset contributed to your accomplishments.

In this article, we will compare a **weak** cover letter versus a **strong one**. Please open up the following documents for reference:

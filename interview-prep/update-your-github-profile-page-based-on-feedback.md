# Update your GitHub profile page based on feedback

## **Learning objectives**

- Prepare a strong GitHub profile

### **Estimated time: 1h**

## **Description**

In this lesson, you'll use the feedback you received from project reviewers to update and improve your GitHub profile.

## Why is it important to update your GitHub profile based on feedback?

As we've mentioned before, very few people are capable of creating perfect first drafts of anything; we all make mistakes, and we can all benefit from constructive critique. By listening to and analyzing feedback from others, we're then able to identify our areas of weakness, and potentially come up with new ideas for how to improve them.

This step of the GitHub editorial process is used to further refine and polish your GitHub profile, so that you'll have the best chance possible of immediately grabbing the attention of any recruiter, hiring manager, or software developer who visits your profile page.

## Project Setup

- Log in to your GitHub account.
- Open your project reviewer's previous numerical and written feedback. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

## Using project reviewer feedback to improve your GitHub profile

As a software developer, your code will periodically undergo code reviews and quality control; this is normal and is a powerful way of helping us learn more and improve on our projects. In a similar way, project reviewers will review your professional skills projects, such as your GitHub, in order to help you identify areas where you have the opportunity to further improve on your work. 

In the link below, we'll discuss a few helpful tips to ensure that you gain the most value from the feedback you receive, and that you're able to implement the feedback efficiently and correctly. We previously shared this link, but it's important to review it before each round of the feedback process to ensure that you're in the best editorial mindset possible.

## Project submission

### Project requirements

- [Make sure that your GitHub profile meets every requirement of the GitHub rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A1x6Vqm6rmChKkb3T3IXBWRNyygTZ2oiHCPZq4IrXT4/edit). If you have followed the [GitHub curriculum](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/becoming-a-remote-professional/create-the-first-draft-of-a-professional-looking-github-profile-page.md), it should do so automatically.
- Make sure that you have addressed **each and every piece of feedback your project reviewer has given you.** Do not skim their feedback; read it aloud carefully to ensure that you don't miss suggestions. If you skip over too much feedback, your project reviewer may return the project to you as invalid, and you will need to revise it and resubmit it again. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

### **Submission instructions**

- Carefully review **all feedback** given to you by your project reviewer.
- Implement **each piece of feedback**, ensuring that you have not accidentally skipped over anything. If you skip over a piece of feedback on purpose, include an explanation in the submissions form below. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
- Run all text on your GitHub profile (including project descriptions, personal README text, and your bio) through a spellcheck and grammar check tool before you submit it, **even if you did so previously**; it is very common to accidentally introduce new errors when making edits/changes to a piece of text.

## Review

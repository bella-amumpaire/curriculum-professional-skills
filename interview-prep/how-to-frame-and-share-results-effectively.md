# How to frame and share results effectively?

Many who have tried to use the SAR method forget about the results bit. They tend to think that describing their miraculous intervention and rushing a happy ending will satisfy the interviewer. Drawing an analogy to movies, think about how you feel when the ending is like this?   

You should not just state the outcome, but also discuss **what you learned, how you grew, and why you’re a stronger employee because of the experience**. 

**Quantify your success or provide concrete examples of the effects of your efforts if possible**. Don't overdo this part, **you need numbers to support your stories, not the other way around**.

Decide what the two to three most impressive results were and talk about these. 

Let's take two examples to highlight the above-mentioned points. The example questions are the same as used in the situation and action part. 

Example 1: **Describe a time when you were under a lot of pressure at work. How did you react?**

**Sample response for the situation:** In my last internship, one of my co-workers quit immediately after signing the biggest client our firm had ever taken on.

Although I was already working on a project, I was assigned this new client as well. I knew the stakes were high and if we lost this deal, then we wouldn’t hit our quarterly goal.

**Sample response for the action:** I first took some measures to destress. Then I carefully evaluated and restructured my task list to make sure I could manage all my duties. Because of this, I was able to make myself completely available to the client. I also sacrificed some evenings and weekends to take calls until the project was delivered.

**Sample response for the result:** The work was delivered successfully adhering to the deadline. The client was impressed with my work, and our company got an annual contract of $1 million. The experience taught me not only about managing pressure situations but also putting into practice the principles of prioritization and time management. 

Example 2: **What major problems have you encountered while working with a team member, and how did you deal with them?**

**Sample response for the situation:** In one of my internships, I had a team member who was working along with me on designing a product.  One day, I got to know that this team member has been sharing stories that weren't true behind my back. 

**Sample response for the action:** I feel that the best way to deal with any challenges is to meet them head-on. I knew it would be a difficult conversation and might sound like blame. Rather than increasing the tension, I decided to approach my team member directly to talk about what I have heard. 

**Sample response for the result:** It turned out they had misunderstood what I had said, and I was able to set the record straight with them, and my supervisor. This experience also made it clear that disagreements and conflicts are inevitable at the workplace. When they are not addressed, it affects the working of team members. I also learned how a disagreement or a conflict can be handled with respect and care.

# How to fill out the Q&A section on Wellfound

The Q&A section is a place where you can answer a range of questions designed to give hiring managers insight into who you are as a person; questions include "what is your favorite business-related book," and "what words of advice would you give to your younger self," for example. You can answer these questions in almost any manner you like, but keep the following two tips in mind:

- Make sure to use proper grammar and punctuation. We recommend copy/pasting your responses into Google Docs and use the spellcheck/grammar check tools there.
- Answer professionally. Remember that hiring managers will be reading this, and any answers that are overly unprofessional could potentially lead to your application being immediately disregarded. Don't give responses that are too personal or intimate, or that might not be work-appropriate.

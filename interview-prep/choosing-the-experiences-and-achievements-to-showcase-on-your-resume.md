# Choosing the experiences and achievements to showcase on your resume

### Decide which experiences to list

Review the scenarios below and pick the one that most closely aligns with your work experience. You will use that scenario to decide which experiences to list on your resume.

**Scenario 1: You have no work experience of any kind and no development-related volunteer activities, extracurriculars, teaching assistantships, or internships.**

Add **2 fields** to your Relevant Experience section:

- "Full Stack Software Developer." This entry will be used to describe achievements and projects you've worked on while studying development.
- "Software Development Mentor (Volunteer)." Most Microverse students eventually serve as mentors. This section will be used to describe how you assisted junior software developers.

**Scenario 2: You have no work experience of any kind, but you do have development-related volunteer activities, extracurriculars, teaching assistantships, or internships.**

Add **2-4 fields** to your Relevant Experience section:

- "Full Stack Software Developer." This entry will be used to describe achievements and projects you've worked on from your time studying development.
- Entries for 1-3 development-related volunteer/extracurricular/etc. positions (for example, if you volunteered with Girls Who Code, or if you were a teaching assistant in a college computer science class).

**Scenario 3: You have no development or technical work experience, but you do have work experience in other fields:**

Add **2-4 fields** to your Relevant Experience section:

- "Full Stack Software Developer." This section will be used to describe achievements and projects you've worked on from your time studying development.
- Entries for 1-3 work experiences. Choose positions that you think will do the best job of demonstrating transferrable skills (such as communication, conflict management, work ethic, or commitment to excellence).

**Scenario 4: You have some development or technical work experiences (including internships), and some work experience in other fields:**

Add **2-4 fields** to your Relevant Experience section:

- Entries for 1-4 of your most recent development work experiences. If you have 4 development experiences, use all 4 entries for development.
- 1 entry for a recent, non-development job. If you have multiple recent non-development jobs to choose from, choose the one you think will do the best job of demonstrating achievements or transferrable skills.
- **Note:** if you have software development work experience, **do not add volunteer experiences to the Relevant Experience section;** instead, save them for the Volunteer section.

**Scenario 5: You have ALL development or tech work experiences (including internships):**

- List **up to 4** of your most recent/most advanced positions. Again, if you have volunteer or extracurricular experiences, don't add them to the Relevant Experience section, but save them for a Volunteer section.

### **Identify which achievements to write about**

When writing a resume, **every single bullet point should highlight an achievement, metric, or skill**.  **Never list job duties**. Your job duties are not impressive; every developer in the world has the same job duties. Every developer in the world debugs code. Every developer in the world collaborates with team members to meet client requirements. Focusing on job duties won't make you stand out; it'll make a hiring manager delete your resume.

Take a few minutes to think about what **made you special as an employee**. Here are some ideas to get you started.

- Company awards you won
- A project you worked on that saved the company money or time
- A project you worked on that improved customer satisfaction
- A project you worked on that pushed your capabilities
- A project you worked on that helped other people
- Something your manager always asked you to do, because you did it better than anyone else

**Identify 3-5 achievements, skills, or awards per job**. Once you've identified them, we'll learn how to format them to catch a hiring manager's attention.

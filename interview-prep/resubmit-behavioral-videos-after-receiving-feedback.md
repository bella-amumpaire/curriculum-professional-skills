# Re-submit behavioral videos after receiving feedback

## Learning objectives

- Practice answering behavioral interview questions in a mock interview setting.

### **Estimated time**: 0.75h

## Description

In this project, you will be updating your behavioral videos after receiving feedback from your coach.

**Note** - This project will be reviewed by one of our career coaches. In order to ensure they are able to review it in a timely fashion, please do your best to submit this no later than the end of your day Wednesday. 

### Why is updating your behavioral videos important?

Your behavioral videos are designed to help you showcase your best skills, both technical and interpersonal, so that you can be prepared for any behavioral interview with recruiters. 

Using the curriculum, you've created behavioral videos that should highlight many of your strengths. It might be difficult to create a perfect video on your first try, though, so we'll now be using the constructive critique and feedback given to you by your coaches to locate areas of improvement.

This step of the behavioral video review process will further refine and polish your video presentation so that you'll have the best chance possible of impressing the hiring managers or recruiters you are interviewing with.

### Using coach feedback to improve your behavioral videos

We've repeatedly discussed the importance and value of good feedback, and you should now recognize how necessary feedback is to the revision process. Just as your code will periodically undergo code reviews and quality control as a software developer, your professional skills projects like your behavioral videos, will also undergo reviews. You will now be expected to use this feedback to identify areas of improvement. 

**Remember that every piece of feedback is intended to help you, not harm you**. If you disagree with some of the coach's suggestions, don't stay quiet; instead, reach out to them asap so they can give you more clarification.

### Project Setup

1. Carefully review **all feedback** from your coach on your behavioral videos.
2. Quickly read through [these guidelines for creating a good behavioral video](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/guidelines-for-creating-a-good-behavioral-video.md).

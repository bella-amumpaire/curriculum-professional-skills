# How to compellingly include career highlights in the Achievements section

The "Achievements" section can be up to 1000 characters long (or about 150). You can write in **either paragraphs or bullet points** (copy/paste the following bullet point: â€¢ ).

Let's walk you through how to complete this section:

1. Copy/paste **3-4 of the most impressive accomplishments listed on your resume/LinkedIn**. If possible, these should be accomplishments that focus on **metrics**. Feel free to elaborate on these accomplishments and add additional detail.
2. Brainstorm **2-4 additional** accomplishments you're proud of. If you're struggling with coming up with some, here are a few ideas to get you started:
    - Academic awards or achievements, even at non-computer science programs. Examples: graduated summa cum laude, author on an academic publication, received a prestigious academic scholarship.
    - Development-related achievements. Examples: completed 100 days of code, published a development-related article on Medium that received X number of likes, competed in and/or won a hackathon.
    - Microverse achievements. Examples: currently enrolled at Microverse, an online software development program that accepts less than 1% of applicants, completed X number of projects within Y days, mentored X number of students in Y ways.
    - A fun, personal achievement (**no more than 1).** Examples: won a hot dog eating contest by eating 32 hotdogs in 10 minutes, successfully climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, completed a triathlon.
3. Copy/paste **all of your bullet points into Google Docs,** and use the spellcheck and grammar check tools (including Grammarly) to identify typos or errors.
4. **Change the order of your bullet points.** While your first bullet points should always be the strongest, if all of your old bullet points come on top, a reader might skim or skip the section entirely. Instead, try to alternate old and new bullet points to keep the reader engaged, or add one of the new bullet points to the very top.

This section might take you a little longer to complete, but it's worth it! By the time you're done, you'll have a list of achievements that will help explain just a few of the things that make you special.

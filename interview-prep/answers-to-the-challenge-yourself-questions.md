# Answers to the Challenge yourself questions
**Answer to question 1:**  SAR means Situation - Action - Result

**Answer to question 2:** The types of questions that need to be answered with the SAR method are those asking about a specific experience. They tend to start with the phrase: "*Tell us about a time when....*." 

**Answer to question 3:** The breakdown of the SAR method for that example is as follows:

- **Situation:** “It was the first day of my boss’s two-week vacation and our agency’s highest-paying client threatened to leave because he didn’t feel he was getting the personalized service he was promised.
- **Action**: I spent my lunch hour on the phone with him talking through his concerns. We even brainstormed ideas for his next campaign.
- **Result**: He was so grateful for the personal attention that he signed another six-month contract before my boss even returned from her trip.”

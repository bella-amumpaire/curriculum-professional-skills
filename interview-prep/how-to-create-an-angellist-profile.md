# Creating your Wellfound profile

First step: [visit Wellfound and create an account](https://wellfound.com/).

During the sign-up process, Wellfound will ask you to fill in a few basic fields, such as your location, role, experience, education, LinkedIn profile, website, job preferences, desired salary, and whether or not you are willing to work remotely. You can come back and edit this information later on, but for now, fill it out as thoroughly as possible. If you're not sure what to put for desired salary, do a quick Google search for the average salary that software developers of your level (junior/senior/etc.) make in your country.

You will then be asked to answer a few questions about your preferred work culture. Read over the choices and select the options that seem to be the best fit for you. One of the questions asks you about what you're looking for in your next job. We've written a set of example text in the image below ("I'm looking for a job that will challenge me, will give me opportunities for mentorship, and will allow me to contribute to the growth and success of the team"), but we encourage you to try to write your own personalized version.

Finally, you will be asked to upload your resume. **Please upload it as a PDF**, as this will allow you to keep your formatting. If your resume is in Google Docs, click **File >> Download >> PDF Document**.

You'll receive an email asking you to verify your email address. Once you do, you can start working on your profile.

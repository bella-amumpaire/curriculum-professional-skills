### Why is receiving feedback from your partner about your video important?

Your behavioral videos are designed to help you showcase your best skills, both technical and interpersonal, so that you can be prepared for any behavioral interview with recruiters. 

Using the curriculum, you've created behavioral videos that should highlight many of your strengths. It might be difficult to create a perfect video on your first try, though, so we'll now be using the constructive critique and feedback given to you by your peer to locate areas of improvement.

This step of the behavioral video review process will further refine and polish your video presentation so that you'll have the best chance possible of impressing the hiring managers or recruiters you are interviewing with.

### Using feedback to improve your behavioral videos

We've repeatedly discussed the importance and value of good feedback, and you should now recognize how necessary feedback is to the revision process. Just as your code will periodically undergo peer reviews that will help you improve, your professional skills producst like your behavioral videos, will also benefit from another person’s reviews. 

**Remember that every piece of feedback is intended to help you, not harm you**. If you disagree with some of the your peer’s suggestions, don't stay quiet; instead, discuss it with them so they can give you more clarification.

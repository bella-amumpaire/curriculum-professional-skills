# Project: Create your Wellfound profile (formerly, AngelList).

## Learning objectives

- Create a clear, compelling Wellfound profile.

### **Estimated time**: 1.5h

## Description

In this project, we'll walk you through completing an Wellfound profile. Wellfound functions very similarly to LinkedIn in that it serves both as an online resume and as a mini-portfolio, but it includes a few additional features that make it extremely useful to developers seeking to apply for jobs. This will be your first version, so it doesn't need to be perfect. Remember that, if any errors exist, you'll receive feedback that you'll be able to use to make improvements. Also, when you start job searching, you will polish this profile with the help of a career coach.

### Why is a strong Wellfound so important?

Now that you've created a LinkedIn profile, you may be wondering why you also need to create a near-identical profile on Wellfound. Most of the material will be exactly the same, and Wellfound isn't used as widely as LinkedIn. Why should you spend the next hour working on Wellfound, when something similar already exists?

The answer is that Wellfound is one of the largest startup job sites online, and because startups sometimes have more limited budgets than bigger companies, they are often more willing to hire developers with more limited experience—including developers who work remotely.

You will be using Wellfound extensively during your job search process--not only to find jobs but also to apply for them with a single click-and-copy/paste.

### Project Setup

1. If you don't already have a Wellfound profile, [sign up for one here](https://wellfound.com/).
2. If you have trouble creating an account, [please use this tutorial on how to create an Wellfound account](how-to-create-an-angellist-profile.md).

## Thoroughly fill in your Wellfound header

The Wellfound profile header is a short, focused space to input contact info, brief biographical information, and a tagline. It's incredibly important, and an incomplete header can signal lack of effort. Luckily, you already have all of the information you need in order to thoroughly fill out the header. We'll discuss how to fill out each field step by step.

**Learn more about the Wellfound header block:**

[What should you include in the Wellfound header?](what-should-you-include-in-the-angellist-header.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Fill out your Wellfound header/intro block with all of the required information listed in the linked lesson above.

## Complete the Experience section

By this point, filling out the Experience section will be simple; just start copy/pasting directly from LinkedIn. Your Wellfound and LinkedIn Experience sections should be nearly identical—with one exception.

**Learn more about the Experience section in Wellfound:**

[What to include in the Experience section on Wellfound](what-to-include-in-the-experience-section-on-angellist.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Take 15 minutes to copy/paste each of your experiences from LinkedIn into the Experience section of your Wellfound profile.
2. Take an additional 10 minutes to carefully review your Experience section and identify any copy/paste errors.

## List your strongest, most technically complex projects

The Wellfound projects section is virtually identical to the LinkedIn projects section, so all you need to do is copy/paste. The only difference is that it's more granular; for example, instead of listing the tools you used for a project in the project description, Wellfound instead provides you with an individual field for tools/technologies.

**Learn more about creating a mini-portfolio using the Wellfound Projects section:**

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Take 5 minutes to select 3-5 of your strongest projects to the add to the Projects section.
2. Take 15 minutes to add each project to the Projects section, copy/pasting all relevant links and project summaries from GitHub into Wellfound.

## Fill in the Education section

Once you've listed your projects, it's time to start filling in the Education section. As we've seen so far, the Wellfound Education section is very similar to the LinkedIn Education section. There are small differences in organization, but the content is exactly the same.

**Learn more about what to include in the Education section:**

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Take 10 minutes to copy/paste your education from LinkedIn into Wellfound.
2. Take an additional 5 minutes to carefully reread your education entries and identify any copy/paste errors.

## Update the About section

The About section in Wellfound shows your skills, achievements and locations. Now, edit this section to continue working on your skills and achievements.

## Completely fill in your Skills

The Wellfound Skills section is great because it not only allows recruiters to find your profile via keyword searches, it also allows hiring managers to very quickly get an idea of what you're good at. And just like on LinkedIn, Wellfound allows you to focus on both technical skills and soft skills.

**Learn more about adding skills to your Wellfound:**

[How to correctly fill in the Skills section of your Wellfound profile](how-to-correctly-fill-in-the-skills-section-of-your-angellist-profile.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Take 10 minutes to copy/paste your skills from LinkedIn to Wellfound.
2. Take an additional 5 minutes to ensure that each skill has been copy/pasted correctly, and that you are not accidentally duplicating skills.

## Show your accomplishments in Achievements

The purpose of the Achievements section is to list career highlights: things that would make you stand out from a crowd of job applicants, events or accomplishments you're particularly proud of, or anything else you'd like to call attention to. While you will be able to copy/paste part of this section from LinkedIn, this is the one section of your Wellfound profile where you may need to write some new material. Even though this means that completing this section may take longer than others, it is still important; the Achievements section is where you prove to recruiters that you go above and beyond.

**Learn more about what to include in the Achievements section:**

[How to compellingly include career highlights in the Achievements section](how-to-compellingly-include-career-highilghts-in-the-achievements-section.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Take 5 minutes to copy-paste achievements from your LinkedIn profile.
2. Take an additional 15 minutes to brainstorm additional achievements.
3. Spend 5-10 minutes examining your text for grammatical or spelling errors.

## (Optional) Personalize your profile by filling out the Investments and Q&A section

The Investments and Q&A section are optional. Answering some questions can be a nice way of further personalizing your profile and showing hiring managers the person behind the developer.

**Learn more about the Q&A section:**

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Optional: take 10-15 minutes to fill the Investment section answer the sample questions in the Q&A field.

## Make sure that your Talent Profile has been filled out

Your [Wellfound Talent Profile](https://wellfound.com/profile/edit) and your Wellfound Public Profile are nearly identical, so you should now see that your Talent Profile is almost entirely complete. However, there are a few fields that you should confirm, and a few more that you still need to fill out. These can be accessed by clicking on the tabs at the top of the talent profile.

# Ensuring your resume seems polished with grammatical consistency

### **Consistency in phrasing**

Here's an example of a set of bullet points that **do not** have grammatical consistency:

- Launched an internal dashboard to six departments and 100+ employees, improving internal systems and reducing employee task time by 20%.
- I was awarded 2nd place at XYZ Hackathon among 200+ participants by building a web app designed to help students identify local volunteer opportunities.
- Created an award-winning mobile app for nursing students with 30,000 downloads.

All of the above are good bullet points that display metrics and accomplishments. **However,** they **are not** grammatically consistent. The first and third bullet points begin with **past-tense verbs** ("launched," "created"). The second bullet point begins with a **first-person pronoun** ("I").

This may seem like a small mistake. But too many small mistakes can make a hiring manager doubt your attention to detail, and can result in rejection.

### **Consistency in punctuation**

Another way to show grammatical consistency is to be consistent in punctuation use. You can choose to end all of your bullet points in periods, or you can choose not to. But you must be consistent with your use. Again, here are examples of bullet points that **do not** have punctuation consistency.

- Launched an internal dashboard to six departments and 100+ employees, improving internal systems and reducing employee task time by 20%
- Awarded 2nd place at XYZ Hackathon among 200+ participants by building a web app designed to help students identify local volunteer opportunities.
- Created an award-winning mobile app for nursing students with 30,000 downloads.

The first bullet point does not end in a period. However, the second and third **do** end in periods. Pick one method and stick with it. Again, while these errors are small, they signal a lack of attention to detail.

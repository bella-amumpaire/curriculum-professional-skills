# What situations to pick up and how to present them effectively?

This might sound obvious, but not everybody understands which situation portrays them in the best light. Sometimes, we are not the best judges of our own character. **The basic principle is that you avoid over-complicating things**. First of all, because you will not have much time to develop a point in full. Secondly, because this will help you make more impact.

It’s also imperative to talk about a **specific instance rather than your general responsibilities**. Share the right amount of relevant detail by identifying the **two or three most important pieces** of information necessary to give the interviewer enough context about the situation.

Let's take two examples to highlight the above-mentioned points. 

Example 1: **Describe a time when you were under a lot of pressure at work. How did you react?**

**What the interviewer wants to know:** If you’re being considered for a high-stress job, the interviewer will want to know how well you can work under pressure. Give a real example of how you’ve dealt with pressure when you respond.

**Sample response for the situation:** In my last internship, one of my co-workers quit immediately after signing the biggest client our firm had ever taken on.

Although I was already working on a project, I was assigned this new client as well. I knew the stakes were high and if we lost this deal, then we wouldn’t hit our quarterly goal.

Example 2: **What major problems have you encountered while working with a team member, and how did you deal with them?**

**What the interviewer wants to know:** With this question, the interviewer is seeking insight into how you handle difficult situations at work. Focus on how you’ve solved a problem or compromised when there was a workplace disagreement.

**Sample response for the situation:** In one of my internships, I had a team member who was working along with me on designing a product.  One day, I learned that this team member had been sharing stories that weren't true behind my back.

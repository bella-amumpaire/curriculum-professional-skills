# Record behavioral question videos

## Learning objectives

- Practice answering behavioral interview questions in a mock interview setting.

### **Estimated time**: 0.75h

## Description

In this exercise, you will practice answering and recording two behavioral questions.

### Why is practicing behavioral questions important?

At Microverse, our objective is to get you ready for real-life interviews, whether they are behavioral interviews or technical interviews.

The reason we ask you to record yourself doing these videos is so that you can practice answering questions, self-assess yourself, and then receive constructive feedback from your partner on how well you present yourself and your answers.

### Guidelines to create a good behavioral video

Since you will be answering two behavioral questions and recording yourself in a video as you answer them, first familiarize yourself with guidelines that help you create a good behavioral video.

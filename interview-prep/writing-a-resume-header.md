# Writing a resume header

### **Your header should be no more than 1/6th of the page**

An overlong header wastes space that could otherwise be used to showcase your accomplishments, and can signal to hiring managers that you're trying to take up space. Keep your header to **no more than 1/6th of the page** (or about 2 inches).

### **Include must-have information**

Headers are somewhat customizable, but there are a few things you **must** include in your header, things you **can** include, things you **should not** include except in specific circumstances, and things you **must not ever include**.

**You must include:**

1. Your **full name**. You may use a preferred name instead of your legal first name.
2. Your desired **job title** (such as "Full-Stack Developer").
3. Your **professional** **email address**.
4. A link to **your portfolio**.
5. A link to **your GitHub profile**.
6. A link to **your LinkedIn profile**.

**You can include** (if you have room):

1. Your phone number. Please include your country code.
2. Your address (**only** city, state, and/or country, **not** the street name/house number)
3. A link to your Wellfound profile.
4. A link to your professional Twitter profile.
5. A link to Medium or any other site where you share development-related writing.

**You should not include** (except in specific circumstances):

1. A photo, unless you're applying to a job in a country/culture where photos are required.
2. Your nationality, unless you're applying to a job that requires you to have specific citizenship.

**You should never include**:

1. Your age or date of birth
2. Your gender or orientation
3. Your ethnicity
4. Your previous salary information

# Crafting a professional summary

There are many ways to create a strong professional summary, and you can find several great examples online ([here an excellent one](https://www.blueskyresumes.com/free-resume-samples/web-developer-resume-sample/)). The examples below, however, have been written to focus on multiple types of pre-Microverse experience. These summaries can be edited and personalized as you wish.

**Example 1: student with previous professional software developer experience**

*Full-stack developer with 4+ years of experience building scalable web applications for mid-sized companies. Career highlights include:*

- *Built an internal metrics dashboard to increase customer data management by 25%, resulting in a company-wide increase in customer satisfaction and employee productivity*
- *Received X Company's 2019 Hero Award, given to employees who made significant contributions to the company*
- *Served as the keynote speaker for X Conference, presenting to upwards of 5000 attendees.*

**Example 2: student with previous internship, volunteer, or freelance developer experience**

*Software engineer with proven experience improving legacy code, mentoring junior developers, and building solutions for projects of all sizes. Accomplishments include:*

- *Contributed to multiple open-source projects ranging from COVID trackers to TensorFlow*
- *Led the creation of a kanban-style activity tracker designed to simplify project management*
- *Developed analytics software to improve data visualization and productivity metrics by 18%*

**Example 3: student with no previous software developer experience**

*Front-end web developer and open-source enthusiast with a love for clean code and accessible design. Pair-programming and remote work aficionado. Fluent in multiple languages, frameworks, and technologies, and capable of ramping up quickly and efficiently.*

### **Three important notes**

- Professional summaries should not be written in complete sentences.
- Bullet points can improve readability, but can also potentially take up more space than desired. Don't use bullet points if you already have a lot of content to add to your resume, and if you decide to use bullet points, limit your total personal summary to **no more than 4-5 lines.**
- **Do not include an objective,** such as "Looking for a software development job." The hiring manager knows you're looking for a job. Objectives are outdated and waste resume space.

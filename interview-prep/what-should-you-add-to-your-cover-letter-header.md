# What should you add to your cover letter header?

Every document you submit for a job application should contain your name and contact info, and your cover letter is no different: at the very least, your header should contain contact information relevant professional links, such as links to your portfolio, LinkedIn, and GitHub. This is to make sure that the hiring manager always has easy access to important sites like your portfolio, and will never have to search through multiple documents in order to locate the link theyâ€™re looking for.

We recommend copy/pasting your header directly from your approved resume onto your cover letter. If you'd like to create a new header, however, please review what to include (and what not to include) [**please review our list of required header information**](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/writing-a-resume-header.md).

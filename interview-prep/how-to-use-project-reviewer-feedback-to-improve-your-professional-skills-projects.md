# How to use project reviewer feedback to improve your professional skills projects

Learning how to properly use feedback is an important skill and one we want to make sure you learn and internalize. In this article, we'll discuss a few tips intended to help you make the most of feedback to create polished application materials and professional skills projects.

**Remember that every piece of feedback is intended to help you, not harm you.**

Most of us instinctively flinch when given constructive criticism; that's a normal reaction, and we expect most of our students to experience that reaction. However, all of the feedback and constructive criticism you'll receive as a Microverse student is to help you improve, so that you can get that much closer to finding a job. Hiring managers and recruiters often receive a hundred applications for a single job, so they are understandably strict when assessing application materials, and occasionally reject applicants based on errors that may seem small. When project reviewers point out those small or large errors, it's because they want you to have the best possible chance for career success.

**Do not skim feedback from project reviewers; carefully read the feedback aloud, line by line.**

Depending on the project, you may receive only a few lines of short feedback on a project, or you could receive multiple paragraphs of long, in-depth feedback. It can be tempting to skim over that long feedback, especially if you are in a rush or nearing the submission deadline. **However, if you skim feedback, likely, you will accidentally skip over requested changes.** If it becomes evident that you have skipped over a substantial number of requested edits, your project reviewer will return the project to you as invalid, and you will need to make the original changes before resubmitting it back to the bottom of the review queue. This could cause you to be held back in the program.

Carefully read the feedback line by line, and implement each piece of feedback before you move on to the next. Once you've made all of the requested changes, read over the feedback one last time just to be sure you haven't missed anything.

**If a project reviewer has left spelling/grammar suggestions directly on a Google Document, you can accept their changes automatically by clicking the "Accept" button.**

Many project reviewers will make grammatical/spelling corrections directly on a Google Document. If they've done so, you can make those edits automatically by clicking the "Accept" button on their suggestion. That will automatically edit your work, and you will not have to manually correct it.

**Reach out to your project reviewer if you have questions!**

Project reviewers are trained to provide accurate feedback clearly and concisely, but everyone makes mistakes. If you're not sure what they mean if you don't know how to implement a specific piece of feedback, or if you disagree with one of their suggestions, **don't stay quiet; instead, reach out to them asap.** Project reviewers endeavor to reply to questions within 24 hours.

# What should you add to the Markets field?

As we've mentioned, you can add any specific industries you're interested in joining in the Markets field: education, finance, clean energy, real estate, transportation, and more. We also recommend updating this field **each time you apply to a job you're especially interested in**. If you see a job on Wellfound that you'd like to apply to, check its list of markets. Then add those to your Market section. For example, if you're applying to Clever, you'll see that its markets include Education, Big Data, and Application Platforms. Add those industries to your Markets section, too.

Adding specific Markets **will not limit you**; you can still apply to jobs in any industry you want. But it's a quick, easy way of establishing rapport with a hiring manager: showing them that you're interested not only in making money but in what their company actually does.

**You must add at least 1 market in order to complete this section**.

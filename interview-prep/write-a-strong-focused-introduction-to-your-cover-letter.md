# Write a strong, focused introduction to your cover letter

The introduction of a cover letter is your first chance to catch a hiring manager's attention, so it's important to make sure that it contains not only the necessary biographical information but also enough personalization to encourage a hiring manager to keep reading. In this lesson, we'll discuss the key elements each introduction should contain.

### **The letter should be addressed to the hiring manager (either by name, or with “Dear Hiring Manager”)**

There have been countless articles and blog posts written about how to correctly address cover letters (some of which contain better advice than others). Current best practices offer only two options, however: cover letters should either be addressed to the hiring manager by name, or with a simple “Dear Hiring Manager.” Salutations like “To whom it may concern” or “Dear Mrs./Mr.” are considered out of date and archaic, and should be avoided. A note: **please avoid** using gendered prefixes. In other words, students should never write anything like “Dear Mr. Alex Gutierrez,” or “Dear Mrs. Ava Adewale.” Gendered prefixes rely on assumptions (for example, assuming you know the hiring manager’s gender or marital status), and should therefore always be avoided. Just use their name.

**Incorrect:** To whom it may concern, Dear Mrs. Ava Adewale, How's it going?

**Correct:** Dear Hiring Manager, Dear Alex Gutierrez

### The introduction must clearly state **both** the job and company the student is applying to

There are many ways to personalize a cover letter, many of which we'll be discussing in this training. The first (and simplest) way to personalize your cover letter, though, is simply to specify exactly which job and company you're applying for. This requirement ensures that the introduction clearly states the name of the company and the prospective job title.

### The introduction should briefly explain why the applicant is interested in this specific position

If you've ever been in a conversation with someone who didn't seem like they actually cared what you were talking about, you know how frustrating lack of interest can be. The same is true when applying for jobs: hiring managers want to know why, specifically, you're applying for a job with them, rather than with a competitor or another company. This is an opportunity to personalize your cover letter, and to explain exactly what you find special about this company--and that sort of personalization can have a huge impact on your chances for an interview. This requirement checks to ensure whether the cover letter has been thoroughly personalized with an explanation of why the applicant is interested in this specific position.

### The introduction needs to briefly explain why the applicant would be a good fit for the job

The goal of the introduction is twofold: firstly, to explain what you admire about a specific company or position, and second, to explain why the hiring manager should be interested in you, rather than in any of the other applicants. This is a chance to explain briefly why you're special, and why you would be a better hire than any of your competitors. This requirement checks to see whether the student has included an explanation of why they specifically would be a good choice for a hiring manager.

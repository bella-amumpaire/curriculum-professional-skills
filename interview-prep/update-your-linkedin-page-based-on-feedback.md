# Update your LinkedIn page based on feedback

## **Learning objectives**

- Create a clear, compelling LinkedIn page.

### **Estimated time: 1h**

## **Description**

In this lesson, you'll use the feedback you received from project reviewers to further improve your LinkedIn profile.

## Why is it important to update your LinkedIn profile based on feedback?

Your LinkedIn profile is an extremely powerful networking and marketing tool: it functions as an online resume, a mini-portfolio, and an elevator pitch all in one, and many Microverse students have received interviews based entirely on the strength of their LinkedIn. Using the curriculum, you've created a LinkedIn profile that does a strong job of highlighting your achievements and potential, but it's hard to create a perfect profile on your first try. You will now be using the constructive critique and feedback given to you by project reviewers to locate errors and areas of weaknesses so that you can strengthen your LinkedIn even further, turning it into a powerful tool in your application toolbox.

## Project Setup

- Open up your LinkedIn.
- Open the written and numerical feedback from your project reviewer, including any feedback they may have left via video platforms like Loom. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

## Using project reviewer feedback to improve your LinkedIn

You've been through the project revision process several times by now, so we trust that you've already internalized the importance and value of good feedback, whether it's feedback on code and projects or feedback on application materials and interview responses. Now that you've received feedback from project reviewers, you will use that feedback to identify areas of improvement in your LinkedIn.

Please review the helpful tips below to ensure that you gain the most value from the feedback you receive, and that you're able to implement the feedback efficiently and correctly.

## Project submission

### Project requirements

- [Make sure that your LinkedIn profile meets every requirement of the LinkedIn rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MHmt3Vx4SRHa7z8PuoUiYg9eLakpi1qGPT6868bacGc/edit). If you have followed the [LinkedIn curriculum](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/create-first-draft-of-a-professional-linkedin-page.md), it should do so automatically.
- Make sure that you have addressed **each and every piece of feedback your project reviewer has given you.** If you skip over too much feedback, your project reviewer may return the project to you as invalid, and you will need to revise it and resubmit it again. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

### **Submission instructions**

- Carefully review **all feedback** given to you by your project reviewer, including both written feedback and verbal feedback they may have given over video platforms like Loom.
- Implement **each piece of feedback**, ensuring that you have not accidentally skipped over anything. If you skip over a piece of feedback on purpose, include an explanation in the submissions form below. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
- Copy/paste the text of your LinkedIn into a Google Document and then run the text through a spellcheck and grammar check tool before you submit it, even if you did so previously; it is very common to accidentally introduce new errors when making changes to a piece of text.

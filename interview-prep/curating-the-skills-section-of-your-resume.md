# Curating the Skills section of your resume

The Skills section lists languages, technologies, and frameworks you know, along with development-related soft skills. This field should take up **no more than 4-6 lines**, and should ideally be organized by section, like so:

- ***Front-end:** JavaScript, React, Redux, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3*
- ***Back-end:** Ruby, Rails, MySQL*
- ***Tools & Methods:** Git, GitHub, Heroku, Netlify, Mobile/Responsive Development, RSpec, TDD, Chrome Dev Tools*
- ***Professional:** Remote Pair-Programming, Teamwork, Mentoring*

The template resumes already list skills you've likely learned at Microverse. Update it as needed, and feel free to add other development-related skills you know as well.

Two important notes: 
- **Only list skills you have an intermediate-level knowledge of.** If a skill is on your resume you'll probably get asked about it during an interview, and if you can't answer intermediate-level questions, the hiring manager might assume you were lying. That can mean **immediate rejection**.
- **Don't rate your skills with stars or percentage.** Stars and percentages are very subjective; include only official certificates of your skills from well-known organizations.

# Review your cover letter for mistakes and areas of improvement

### Check for grammatical and punctuation errors

The cover letter is likely the longest thing that you will ever write during the application process, so it's one of your best chances of displaying strong written communication abilities. This requirement ensures that you haven't introduced a number of grammatical or punctuation errors in the content of their letter.

### Check for spelling and capitalization errors

Spelling and capitalization errors are particularly easy for a spellcheck tool to catch, so it's extremely important that cover letters be free of these simple errors. This requirement checks whether or not the student has introduced spelling/capitalization errors into the content of their cover letter.

### Locate and fix run-on sentences

While run-on sentences have their place in creative writing, they should be avoided in professional communication. Run-on sentences can be confusing and can decrease clarity, and are rarely acceptable in cover letters. This requirement ensures that sentences are not overlong and that each sentence appropriately uses periods and commas.

### Check that all sentences are written clearly, so that a hiring manager will have no trouble understanding each point

Sentence clarity is an extremely important factor to demonstrate strong written communication abilities, and is necessary when writing professionally in English. This requirement is related to the previous, in that run-on sentences can sometimes negatively affect sentence clarity, but sentence clarity can also be impacted by other mistakes: missing articles/prepositions, incorrect punctuation usage, lack of context.

### Ensure that the cover letter is an appropriate length: no less than 2/3rds of a page, no more than 1 page.

A good cover letter should make the case for an applicant's technical and professional skills, and should provide enough context to be both compelling and thorough. A cover letter that is too short (shorter than perhaps 2/3rds of a page) will have a difficult time of doing this fully. However, hiring managers don't typically have enough time to read extremely long cover letters from every applicant, so an overlong cover letter (longer than a single page) can also be detrimental to a job application.

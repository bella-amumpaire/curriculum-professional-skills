# What does SAR mean?

SAR stands for: 

**Situation**.

**Action**.

**Result**.

Imagine if the interviewer asks you “How did you deal with a disagreement within your team?”

In SAR format, you can frame your response as mentioned below:

- **First, you describe the situation:** a particular instance where your goals and those of the team were misaligned.
- Then, you describe the **actions you took to solve this conflict**.
- Finally, you **explain the results** linked to your intervention.

# Make final changes to resume based on feedback

## **Learning objectives**

- Create a strong resume that will pass applicant tracking systems.

### **Estimated time: .5h**

## **Description**

In this lesson, you'll use the feedback you received from your previous resume reviews to make any remaining edits to your resume.

## Why is it important to make one last round of revisions before finalizing your resume?

Your resume is one of the most important tools you have in your job searching toolbox, and even minor errors can result in rejections. You've used the curriculum and project revision process to make substantial improvements to your resume, but before you officially complete this project, you'll undergo one final round of revisions.

The purpose of this final revision round is to ensure that neither you nor your project reviewers have missed an error or area of improvement that could potentially prevent you from receiving interview requests. It's also intended to catch any errors that may have been accidentally introduced in previous editing processes.

Remember: the effort you invest in creating and refining your resume is an effort that will be repaid once you start job searching. **Put all of your effort into the resume editing process**; your future, newly-employed self will thank you.

## Project Setup

- Open up your resume in Google Docs
- Open all written and numerical resume feedback from your project reviewer(s). You can find written feedback on your dashboard for each project under the **Action-->View Reviews** button.

## Project submission

### Project requirements

- [Make sure that your resume meets every requirement of the resume rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lxBFRdvPW_cLQpX8n_gj8O8t1XPcXjGTDOCI813Uga0/edit). If you have followed the [resume curriculum](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/create-the-first-draft-of-your-resume.md), it should do so automatically.
- Make sure that you have addressed **each and every piece of feedback your project reviewer has given you.** Do not skim their feedback; read it aloud carefully to ensure that you don't miss suggestions. **If you skip over too much feedback, your project reviewer may return the project to you as invalid, and you will need to revise it and resubmit it again, which could delay your progress in the program.** You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

### **Submission instructions**

_Check out this FAQ if you need a refresher on [Google Doc submission best practices](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063156813)_

- Carefully review **all feedback** given to you by your project reviewer, including comments and suggestions written directly on the Google Doc.
- Implement **each piece of feedback**, ensuring that you have not accidentally skipped over anything. If you skip over a piece of feedback on purpose, include an explanation in the submission form below. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
- Run your document through Grammarly before you submit it, even if you did so previously; it is very common to accidentally introduce new errors when making edits/changes to a piece of text.

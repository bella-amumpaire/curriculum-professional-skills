# Key elements to answer the "Tell me about yourself question"

Your answer to this question should summarize who you are, what makes you special, what stack you prefer, and why you want to be a software developer. It should cover 5 focal points:

1. Refers to their background about their career as software developers: if non-technical experiences or attributes are mentioned, their impact on the student’s career as a software developer should be noted.
2. Gives enough detail and context for any listener, not familiar with the same organizations or schools.
3. Is clear and concise.
4. Is unique and personal.
5. Engages and arouses your interest in the person.

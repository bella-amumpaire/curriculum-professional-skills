# Condense your elevator pitch into 300 characters

Go to LinkedIn and copy the first 1-2 paragraphs of the "About" section. **Don't include your tech stack or your call to action**; instead, focus on your first few sentences, where you introduce yourself and talk a bit about why you're special. Then paste it in the "What I Do" field.

You may need to edit this section a bit to make it fit into 300 characters. Here's an example of how I condensed my LinkedIn About into a shorter Wellfound About.

**LinkedIn:** _Hi friends! I'm a career coach, educator, and no-code developer who specializes in building complex automations using tools like Zapier and Integromat. I'm the type of person who thinks that spending an afternoon on Metabase is a legitimately good time, and I've never met a bug I didn't want to squash. I'm currently working at Microverse, a global online school for remote software developers, where I build the processes that allow both our students and our employees to go through the work of changing lives._ (512 characters)

**Wellfound:** _Career coach, educator, and no-code developer who specializes in building complex automations using tools like Zapier and Integromat. The type of person who thinks that spending an afternoon on Metabase is a legitimately good time. Currently working at Microverse, helping others change the world._ (297 characters)

It may take a few minutes to condense your elevator pitch into a 300-character "What I Do" section, but the time is worth it. After you've condensed your pitch, make sure to read your "What I Do" aloud--this will help you ensure that you haven't accidentally introduced any copy/paste errors.

# Project: Create the first version of your resume

## Learning objectives

- Create a strong resume that will pass applicant tracking systems (ATSs).

### **Estimated time**: 2.5h

## Description

In this project, we'll be walking you step by step through the process of building a resume designed to highlight your achievements and catch a hiring manager's eye. 

### Why is a strong resume so important?

Your resume is arguably the most important project you'll work on during Professional Skills. Every time you submit a job application, the first thing a hiring manager looks at will likely be your resume; in other words, for most applicants, the resume is your one chance at a first impression. Your resume is going to be the main reason whether you get invited to interviews or you don't. Unfortunately, most resumes are badly written, and most resumes therefore automatically end up in the "rejection" pile. 

This project will walk you through **how to write a resume designed to attract a hiring manager's attention, even if you don't have prior software development work experience**. This will be your first version, so don't worry about getting it perfect this round. You will get feedback from a reviewer that you can use to improve it and you will get a max of 5 reviews for this project. Also, later on, when you are job searching, you will polish your resume with the support of a career coach.

[Learn about the three main components of a strong resume (video lesson)](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/learn-about-the-three-main-components-of-a-strong-resume-video-lesson.md)


### Project Setup

1. Choose one of the ATS-compatible and content-efficient resume templates below. You will be able to make changes to these resumes, such as by choosing new fonts and colors or by reorganizing sections as needed, but you **must choose one of these templates. Note:** you **do not have Edit access** to these files. You will need to **make a copy** to your own Google Drive so you can edit your own resume.
    - [Template 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1isShs6xwmLqRoBjsmDgMq1SBXkvd0GcKSOwpI4rAboE/edit?usp=sharing): Traditional, corporate. Single column. Good for students with minimal experience.
    - [Template 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iz_P3dBX787ABfm_r7I9xR8bQa5Wb8hlRkHUiwI_VAg/edit?usp=sharing): Modern, easy to read. Single column. Good for students with minimal experience.
    - [Template 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kmsNiP_E-NUCPMpw2Tq8U2cxEIeI0JEECnagSEdlkjw/edit?usp=sharing): Modern and professional. Single column.
    - [Template 4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kWikoIDAKUK1SBeEctIHVj6zpaVDsDcDzjXGU_JI6fo/edit?usp=sharing): Traditional, corporate. Two columns. Inspired by [Serif](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/?ftv=1&tgif=c).
    - [Template 5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jMxmTpC1kZT2F6wcyXeM_0NEdhuWbRhYeYUSaP0qNAk/edit?usp=sharing): Traditional, corporate, confident. Two columns.

2. Build the resume in Google Docs. This will allow project reviewers to leave comments and suggestions directly on the document. If you would later like to save your document in another file format (such as a .pdf), Google Docs allows you to export files using multiple file formats.

3. Share your document so that **anyone with the link** can make suggestions. If you do not share access to your resume, project reviewers will not have an easy way to provide you with feedback, your resume will be **returned to you** without edits, and you may be delayed in your progress in the program.

## Write a short but effective resume header

Your resume header **is a short way to guide hiring managers to your portfolio, contact information, and professional online profiles**. That way, if a hiring manager hasn't fully decided whether to interview you, they'll be able to easily click to your portfolio or LinkedIn profile in order to help them make a decision.

**Learn more about how to create an effective and space-efficient header:**

[Writing a resume header](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/writing-a-resume-header.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Using one of the templates linked above, fill out your header with all of the required information.

## Draft a professional summary (optional)

The professional summary (or profile) is a 2-3 sentence-long section that briefly describes **who you are, the cool things you've done, and/or the awesome things you're capable of**. The summary is optional, but can be a good way to frame how a hiring manager looks at you, especially if you either have a lot of development experience **or** if you have no development experience whatsoever.

**Learn more about the professional summary and whether to include one:**

[Crafting a professional summary](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/crafting-a-professional-summary.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. If you'd like to include a professional summary in your resume, take 5-10 minutes to write one. Feel free to use the examples above for inspiration, but do not copy them exactly.

## Decide on an organizational strategy

The content you prioritize depends on your experience. Your most persuasive content should be placed at the top of the resume, where a hiring manager will read most closely. However, which content is most persuasive will depend on how much experience you have. In the link below, we've created a few organization outlines based on common student backgrounds. Please find the scenario that most closely applies to you, and use that as a guide to organizing your content.

**Learn more about how to organize your resume for best effect:**

[Organizing the content of your resume](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/organizing-the-content-of-your-resume.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Decide on an organizational strategy using the examples in the link above.
2. If needed, reorganize your resume template based on that new organizational strategy. **Be careful if moving sections around to ensure you don't introduce accidental errors.**

## Learn what to include in the Skills section

The Skills section may be short, but it's also a section that is prone to weakness: many people include too much information, not enough information, or the wrong sort of information. In the link below, we'll learn about how to curate a solid Skills section.

**Learn more about what to include in the Skills section of your resume:**

[Curating the Skills section of your resume](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/curating-the-skills-section-of-your-resume.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. If needed, update the Skills section of your resume.

## Create an **experience section that highlights your best achievements and accomplishments to list on your resume**

The Experience section of your resume is where hiring managers will ideally spend the most time, whether you have decades of experience or you're fresh out of college. The first step to writing your work experience is selecting the jobs to showcase. Remember: a resume **should not necessarily be comprehensive;** instead, it should be highly focused. In the link below, you'll find a list of a few common student scenarios. Pick the scenario that best fits you, and then use the advice there to select which jobs to list on your resume.

**Learn more about how to decide which experiences belong on your resume:**

[Phrasing and framing your achievements so you stand out among other applicants](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/phrasing-and-framing-your-achievements-so-you-stand-out-among-other-applicants.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Take 5-10 minutes to identify which work experiences to list on your resume.
2. Take 5-10 minutes to identify which achievements to list for each work experience.
3. Take up to 30 minutes to rewrite your achievements using the formulas in the link above to **best highlight your metrics and accomplishments.**

## Learn about the optional "Other Experience" section

The "Other Experience" section is an optional section that can include non-work related activities and accomplishments, like hackathons, volunteer positions, and open-source contributions. Not every person should include this section, though. In the links below, we'll review whether or not this optional section would benefit you, and if so, what to list there.

**Learn more about the "Other Experience" section:**

[Deciding what to highlight in the "Other Experience" section](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/deciding-what-to-highlight-in-the-other-experience-section.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Decide whether to add an "Other Experience" section.
2. If so, take 5-10 minutes to identify which experiences to list in this section.
3. If so, take 5-10 minutes to identify which achievements to list for each experience.
4. Take up to 25 minutes to rewrite your achievements using the formulas in the "Experience" section link. 

## Learn about the optional (but recommended) Projects section

The Projects Section is technically optional, but many students would benefit from including one. In the links below, we'll discuss how to decide whether you need a Projects section, and if so, what to include there.

**Learn more about the Projects section of your resume:**

[Determining what to include in the optional Projects section](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/determining-what-to-include-in-the-optional-projects-section.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Decide whether to add a "Projects" section.
2. If so, take 5 minutes to identify which projects to list.
3. If so, take 5-10 minutes to add your projects to the resume. You may copy the project descriptions from GitHub.

## Complete and refine the Education Section

Every resume should have an Education section, even if you never completed a formal degree program. But what you choose to include in the Education section will depend on the amount of and type of education you have. We'll discuss three common student scenarios below.

**An important note:** do **not** include high school/secondary school education in this section. The Education section is only for college/university/grad school **or** for long-term software development programs like Microverse.

[Showcasing your educational achievements in your resume](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/showcasing-your-educational-achievements-in-your-resume.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Take 2-3 minutes to identify which education experiences to list.
2. Take 5-10 minutes to add your education experiences to your resume.
3. Take 15-20 minutes to rewrite educational achievements using the formulas in the "Experience" section link. 

## Maintain grammatical consistency in your resume

Grammatical consistency simply means that if you use one grammatical format for one sentence, you need to use it for all of them. If one bullet point begins with a past-tense verb, then they should all begin with a past-tense verb. We'll take a look at a few ways to demonstrate consistency in your resume.

**Learn more about grammatical consistency in your resume:**

[Ensuring your resume seems polished with grammatical consistency](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/ensuring-your-resume-seems-polished-with-grammatical-consistency.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Take 10-15 minutes to review your resume closely to check for grammatical consistency. 

## Maintain design consistency in your resume

Design consistency means ensuring that the elements of your resume design (such as indentations, fonts, bolding/italics/underlines, etc.) are consistent within and between sections. Design consistency is another important element of a strong resume, and can signal poor attention to detail if you skip it.

All of the Microverse-verified templates already have design consistency, so if you use those templates without changes, your resumes will automatically be consistent. However, many of you will make changes to the template as you reorganize sections or change fonts. When doing so, you must keep an eye out for consistency. In the link below, we'll examine the three major elements of design consistency.

**Learn more about design consistency in your resume:**

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Take 10-15 minutes to review your resume closely to check for design consistency. 

## Ensure your resume pays attention to spelling, grammar, tense, and clarity

Proper grammar, spelling, and sentence clarity are essential not only to demonstrate attention to detail but also to showcase your English abilities. For that reason, it's important to make use of tools to help you improve these elements of your resume.

# Phrasing and framing your achievements so you stand out among other applicants

### **Phrase your achievements so they stand out**

Each bullet point you write should follow **one of these three basic formats:**

1. [Task you accomplished], [metric you improved as a result]. **Preferred.**
2. [Task you accomplished], [why you were able to accomplish it].
3. [Skill you displayed], [positive result of the skill].

If desired, you can switch the order of these sentences (for example, positive result first, impressive skill second). The important thing is that **each bullet point needs to contain a positive result or metric.** Below, we'll take a look at several examples of how to use these three formats to create persuasive bullet points.

**Format 1**

**Input:** Created a web app for a local business
**Output:** Designed and developed a React-based delivery platform (task you accomplished), increasing web traffic by 30% and boosting online sales within days of launch (metric you improved as a result).

**Input:** Built an internal dashboard to help track support requests
**Output:** Built a department-wide dashboard to help track support requests (task you accomplished), improving the speed of resolved help tickets by 20% and contributing to a 1.5 point increase in tech support satisfaction (metric you improved as a result).

**Input:** Refactored code to speed up internal processes
**Output:** Refactored monolithic codebase (task you accomplished), increasing test coverage by 150% and speeding up internal processes by a factor of 2 (metric you improved as a result).

**Format 2**

**Input:** Won employee of the month several times
**Output:** Repeatedly earned company-wide awards (task you accomplished) as a result of outstanding performance and ongoing commitment to excellence (why you were able to accomplish it).

**Input:** Promoted multiple times in 2 years
**Output:** Earned multiple lateral and vertical promotions over a 2-year period (task you accomplished) as a result of efficiency, leadership, and project management skills (why you were able to accomplish it).

**Format 3**

**Input:** Regularly asked by manager to deal with unruly customers
**Output:**  Used communication skills, empathy, and crisis management abilities to forge strong bonds with distressed customers (skill you displayed), leading to increased customer satisfaction and improved online reviews (positive result of the skill).

**Input:** Had an average customer satisfaction rating of 9.2
**Output:** Earned exceptional year-end reviews and an average customer rating of 9.2/10 (positive result of the skill) as a result of my comprehensive, customer-first approach to sales and support (skill you displayed)

This is the most difficult part of your resume, so don't be worried if you find yourself struggling or taking more time than expected. **Forget about perfection and just write the first draft**; your project reviewer and career coach will help you refine it.

### **Finalize the Relevant Experience section**

Remember: your resume should not be more than 1 page long, and the Relevant Experience section should take up roughly 50-60% of the whole resume. Aim for **10-15 bullet points** in the entire Rele vant Experience section. If this section takes up too much space, pick 1 or 2 of the "weakest" bullet points and delete them.

# Submit behavioral question videos for coach feedback

## Learning objectives

- Practice answering behavioral interview questions in a mock interview setting.

### **Estimated time**: 0.75h

## Description

In this project, you will practice answering and recording two behavioral questions.

**Note** - This project will be reviewed by one of our career coaches. In order to ensure they are able to review it in a timely fashion, please do your best to submit this no later than the end of your day Wednesday. 

### Why is practicing behavioral questions important?

At Microverse, our objective is to get you ready for real-life interviews, whether they are behavioral interviews or technical interviews.

The reason we ask you to record yourself doing these videos is so that the coaches can give you constructive feedback on how well you present yourself and your answers, as well as tips for you to improve your performance for the real interviews.

### Guidelines to create a good behavioral video

In this project, you will be answering two behavioral questions and recording yourself in a video as you answer them. The guidelines below will help you create a good behavioral video:

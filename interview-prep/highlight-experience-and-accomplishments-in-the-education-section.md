# Highlight experience and accomplishments in the Education section

Open your LinkedIn profile and copy/paste the material from your approved LinkedIn to your Wellfound profile. There are only a few things to keep in mind:

- Again, if you want to use bullet points you will need to copy/paste them. You can copy/paste this one directly into the Wellfound description section: â€¢
- When selecting the Degree Type for your Microverse entry, make sure to choose **Non-Degree Program**. It is near the bottom of the list.
- **Do not** add your GPA to a degree unless you are both a **recent graduate AND** your **GPA was high** (for example, at least a 3.5 on a 4.0 scale).
- **Do not** add high school education.
- If your education is **in-progress**, use your estimated graduation in the date field. If your education is **incomplete** and you don't plan to immediately return to school, use the date that you last attended school in the date field, and in the description field, add a note saying "Degree incomplete."

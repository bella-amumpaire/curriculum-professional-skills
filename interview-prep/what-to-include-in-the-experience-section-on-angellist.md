# What to include in the Experience section on Wellfound

In just a moment, you'll be able to start copy/pasting experiences from your LinkedIn to Wellfound. However, before you do, **please keep the following things in mind:**

As we mentioned previously, there's one main difference between the experience sections on LinkedIn and Wellfound: Wellfound does not have a Volunteer Experience section. Therefore, if you have Volunteer experiences in your LinkedIn, **add them to the Experience section of Wellfound instead**. However, **make sure to add (Volunteer) to the job title, like so**: "Student Mentor (Volunteer)."

Other than that, here are three additional notes to keep in mind:

- If you're copy/pasting a Self-Employed entry, the company name should be "**Self-Employed**." There is another popular option that says "Freelancer, Self- Employed," but that option contains a typo that reflects negatively on those who use it.
- Wellfound doesn't currently support Markdown, so asterisks in the description will not turn into bullet points. Instead, copy/paste bullet points into Wellfound directly. You can copy/paste this one: â€¢
- If you'd like to add multiple positions at the same company, click the "Add another role" button underneath the "This is a current position" checkbox.

Now that you've read over what to be aware of when filling out the Experience section on Wellfound, start copy/pasting your content from LinkedIn into Wellfound!

# Showcasing your educational achievements in your resume

### **What to include in the Education section**

Deciding what to include in the Education section isn't always straightforward, and will depend on what types (if any) of education you've had. We'll discuss three common student scenarios below.

**An important note:** do **not** include high school/secondary school education in this section. The Education section is only for college/university/grad school or for long-term software development programs like Microverse.

**If you don't have college/university experience:**

- List "Microverse Software Development School" in this section, and include 1-3 bullet points showcasing your accomplishments. You may use the default bullet points found in the resume templates.
- If you attended any other long-term (3+ months) software development programs, you may also list them here, along with 1-2 bullet points about accomplishments.

**If you have non-computer science college/university experience:**

- List "Microverse Software Development School" in this section, and include 1-3 bullet points showcasing your accomplishments. You may use the default bullet points found in the resume templates.
- List the name(s) of your college/university, your major/degree field, and the years of attendance. **Do not** list any bullet points **unless** they showcase extremely impressive accomplishments. **Do not** list your GPA unless you attended school recently and your GPA was very strong (at least 3.5 on a 4.0 scale).

**If you have computer science college/university experience:**

- List "Microverse Software Development School" in this section, and include 1-3 bullet points showcasing your accomplishments. You may use the default bullet points found in the resume templates.
- List the name(s) of your college/university, your major/degree field, and the years of attendance. Include 2-3 bullet points. One bullet point should list major/most impressive coursework. The other 1-2 bullet points should list accomplishments.

### **Three important notes to remember**

1. If your degree is **in progress** and you are still actively pursuing your degree, format your experience and dates like so: Bachelor of Science in Biology (In Progress), Expected Graduation Date June 2021. If your degree is **incomplete** and you don't plan to continue pursuing your degree, format your experience like so: Bachelor of Science in Biology (Incomplete).
2. Remember that your resume should be 1-page long. If you have several college experiences and your resume is bleeding into 2 pages, omit the least relevant or the oldest experiences.
3. Use the achievement formats in the "Experience" section to format your Education bullet points (if any).

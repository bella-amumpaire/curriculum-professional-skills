## Learning objective

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

In this lesson, you will learn how to effectively follow up with a recruiter after an interview.

### Why is knowing how to follow up after an interview important?

When you haven't heard from a recruiter for a job you are very interested in, it is important to have the right follow-up technique. Sending too many messages can be overbearing for the recruiter while sending inappropriate or unprofessional messages can put you on the company's blacklist. We want to avoid this by following the right techniques.

# Update your Wellfound based on feedback

## **Learning objectives**

- Create a clear, compelling Wellfound profile.

### **Estimated time: 1h**

## **Description**

In this lesson, you'll use the advice and feedback you previously received from project reviewers to further expand upon and improve your Wellfound profile.

## Why is it important to update your Wellfound profile based on feedback?

Wellfound is one of the largest, most well-respected startup-centric job boards on the internet, and a strong Wellfound profile can be the difference between receiving interview requests and receiving no response to a job application at all. Much like your LinkedIn profile, Wellfound functions as an online resume, a mini-portfolio, and an elevator pitch all in one, and while you should have already used the curriculum to create a profile that showcases your achievements, projects, and potential, it's hard to create a perfect profile on your first try. You will now be using the constructive critique and feedback given to you by project reviewers to locate errors and areas of weaknesses so that you can improve your Wellfound even further.

## Project Setup

- Open up your Wellfound.
- Open the written and numerical feedback from your project reviewer, including any feedback they may have left via video platforms like Loom. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

## Using project reviewer feedback to improve your Wellfound

Just as you've done several times before, you'll now go through the process of revising your Wellfound profile based on the feedback that you received from your project reviewer. As we've said multiple times, good feedback is invaluable and can make a huge difference in a project's efficacy and strength. Now that you've received feedback from project reviewers, you will use that feedback to identify areas of improvement in your Wellfound.

If needed, please review the tips below to ensure that you gain the most value possible from the feedback you've receive, and that you're able to implement the feedback efficiently and correctly.

## Project submission

### Project requirements

- [Make sure that your Wellfound profile meets every requirement of the Wellfound rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZHhPBL8w6tqSlVDOWI4u9kMVCQtxeDDL9aL3j0VQ2iA/edit). If you have followed the [Wellfound curriculum](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/create-the-first-draft-of-your-angellist-profile.md), it should do so automatically.
- Make sure that you have addressed **each and every piece of feedback your project reviewer has given you.** If you skip over too much feedback, your project reviewer may return the project to you as invalid, and you will need to revise it and resubmit it again. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

### **Submission instructions**

- Carefully review **all feedback** given to you by your project reviewer, including both written feedback and verbal feedback they may have given over video platforms like Loom.
- Implement **each piece of feedback**, ensuring that you have not accidentally skipped over anything. If you skip over a piece of feedback on purpose, include an explanation in the submissions form below. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
- Copy/paste the text of your Wellfound into a Google Document and then run the text through a spellcheck and grammar check tool before you submit it, even if you did so previously; it is very common to accidentally introduce new errors when making changes to a piece of text.

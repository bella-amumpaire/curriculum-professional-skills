# Deciding what to highlight in the "Other Experience" section

### **Should you include an "Other Experience" section?**

Deciding whether to include an "Other Experience" section depends on a combination of three factors:

- How much room do you still have on your resume?
- How much professional software development work experience do you have?
- How valuable are these other experiences?

If you still have some room left on your resume, or if your professional development work experience is limited: **yes**, feel free to include an "Other Experience" section, if relevant to you.

If you don't have a lot of room left on your resume or if you already have a lot of development work experience: **no**, use your space for work experience rather than extracurricular activities.

If one of the experiences is **extremely** valuable (such as winning an industry-renowned Hackathon): **yes**, please list it in an "Other Experience" section.

### **What can you include in the "Other Experience" section?**

The "Other Experience" section is an optional section designed to showcase any non-work software development experiences you've had. This can include:

- Volunteer positions (**unless** you've already listed them in Relevant Experience)
- Hackathons
- Open-source contributions
- Development-related research papers or articles you've written
- Software development internships (**unless** you've already listed them in Relevant Experience)
- Computer science-related teaching assistant or research positions (**unless** you've already listed them in Relevant Experience)

Remember that even if you add this section, your resume should still be 1-page long. If you'd like to include an "Other Experience" section, make sure that it will still fit the length limit, and pick **no more than 3** "extracurricular" positions to add.

### **Write a short summary or 1 to 3 bullet points per entry**

If you've decided to include an "Other Experience" section, you must also include **1-3 results-focused bullet points** (or a short summary) per entry. Refer back to the previous lesson on writing achievement-focused bullet points.

Limit yourself to **no more than 3 bullet points per position**. Again, the "Other Experience" is less important than the "Work/Relevant Experience" section, so it should be shorter.

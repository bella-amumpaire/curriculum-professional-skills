## Learning objectives

- Answer common behavioral questions in the SAR format.

### Estimated time: 1.5h

## Description

In this lesson, you will learn SAR format to answer common behavioral questions.

### Why is learning SAR format to answer common behavioral questions important?

SAR format gives a framework to communicate your responses to common behavioral questions.   If you have applied for the right position, have adequate skills and experiences, then the SAR format will help you elaborate on who you are.  SAR format makes it easy for the interviewers to understand the response you give to the behavioral question. But what makes SAR format so important in behavioral interviews?

### Definition of SAR

**Guiding questions:**

*Think about these questions as you learn about SAR format.*

- How can I put my answers in SAR format?
- Can I start figuring out what an answer based on SAR format will look like?

In one of our previous exercises, we briefly touched upon what SAR means and how it can be used in behavioral interviews.

### Behavioral question and the first step

**Guiding questions:**

- What do you think would be the very first step after a question is asked?

The very first step right after the question is asked is not to respond with a situation. Before sharing our response, we need to quickly assess what the interviewer is trying to ask through this question.     

### Picking up the appropriate situations

**Guiding questions:**

*Think about these questions as you learn about picking up appropriate situations.*

- Which situations will feel appropriate to share with the interviewer?
- What should I keep in mind while sharing the situation?

When you don’t have a long professional history to draw from, consider examples from internships, volunteer work, or group projects you completed at Microverse. In some cases, employers may ask you to share a non-work-related example, so consider challenges or obstacles you’ve overcome in your personal life, too.

### Framing the action correctly

After sharing the situation, it's the Action that comes next. Explain the specific actions you took to handle the situation or overcome the challenge.

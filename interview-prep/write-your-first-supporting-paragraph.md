# Write your first supporting paragraph

### Briefly discuss your development qualifications

The purpose of a cover letter is to tell a story: to discuss achievements in order to then explain why you would be able to translate those achievements into success at this new company. In order to tell a compelling story, however, the paragraph needs to begin with a "set up" or thesis statement. In other words, the paragraph should start by explaining the student's background, or by making a claim. You can do this in several ways, but here are some common ones:

- by giving a brief overview of your development experience
- by listing 1-3 of the professional skills that make you a good developer, or
- by briefly explaining why you would be successful at a specific company

This should be briefâ€”no more than 1-3 sentences.

### Use the biographical information/development qualifications you've previously discussed in order to provide evidence of your soft skills

The first supporting paragraph should begin with the "set up," or with a thesis statement: for example, by giving a brief overview of some of the projects you've built while learning software development. Once you've listed your development qualifications, though, you then need to **discuss the soft skills/professional skills that have allowed you to succeed in that development qualification.** There are several ways to do this, but here are some common ones:

- By telling a story about a time you displayed strong technical or behavioral skills.
- By giving an example that supports the technical/behavioral skill you've claimed to have.
- By discussing common feedback you've received from peers, bosses, or managers (with the aim of supporting your "thesis statement").
- By going into further detail about your work/behavioral habits and ethics.

This should be longer than the previous section: at least 2-5 sentences. The aim here is to provide evidence of the claim you've made. For example, if you previously claimed that you were a strong developer with fantastic attention to detail, you can tell a story about a time that your attention to detail led you to catch a bug that would have otherwise caused a project to fail entirely.

### Clearly connect your soft skills to your strength as a developer or job candidate

Students must clearly explain why the story, example, or praise you've discussed in your first supporting paragraph is clearly relevant to your future success as software developers. This can be done implicitly (for example, by telling a specifically development-related story) or explicitly (for example, by telling a story that discusses your customer-first mindset and then explicitly explaining how you bring that customer-first mindset to fruition when designing the UX of an app).

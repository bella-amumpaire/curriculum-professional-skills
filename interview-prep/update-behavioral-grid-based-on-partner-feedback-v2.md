# Update behavioral grid based on your partner's feedback

## Learning objectives

- Answer common behavioral questions in the SAR format.

### **Estimated time**: .5h

## Description

In this exercise, you will update your behavioral grid after receiving feedback from your partner.

### Why is updating your behavioral grid important?

Your behavioral grid helps you prepare for behavioral interviews. It serves as a reference to plan how to showcase your technical and professional skills, present yourself in your best light to hiring managers, and, thus, leave a good impression so that they want to hire you. Using the curriculum, you've created a grid that will highlight many of your strengths. 

Since It might be challenging to create a perfect grid on your first try, we'll now be using the constructive critique and feedback given to you by your partner to locate errors and areas of improvement. This step of the behavioral grid review process will further refine and polish your grid so that you'll have the best chance of impressing the hiring managers or recruiters you are interviewing.

### Project Setup

1. Open up your behavioral grid in Google Docs.
2. Open the peer-to-peer feedback your coding partner shared in [this exercise](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/polish-your-behavioral-grid-with-your-partner-feedback.md).

### Use your partner’s feedback to improve your behavioral grid

We've repeatedly discussed the importance and value of good feedback, and you should now recognize how necessary feedback is to improve your work. Just as your code gets better with input from peers and reviewers, your job searching materials, like your behavioral grid, will also benefit from reviews by others. Therefore, you will now use your partner’s feedback to identify areas of improvement in your behavioral grid.

### Instructions

*Check out this FAQ if you need a refresher on [Google Doc submission best practices](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063156813).*

1. Carefully review **all feedback** given to you by your partner.
2. Implement **each piece of feedback**, ensuring that you have not accidentally skipped over anything.
3. Run your document through a spellcheck and grammar check tool like Grammarly before you submit it, even if you did so previously; it is prevalent to accidentally introduce new errors when making changes to a piece of text.


## Submit your exercise

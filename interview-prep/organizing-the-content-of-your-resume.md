# Organizing the content of your resume

### Decide on an organizational strategy

Choose the scenario below that most closely applies to you and **reorganize your template layout based on that outline**. 

**If you have no work experience and no computer science degree OR if you have primarily non-software work experience and no computer science degree:**

1. Professional Summary section (optional but encouraged for those with limited experience)
2. Skills section
3. Projects section
4. Relevant Experience section (we'll discuss what to include here later)
5. Other Experience section (such as internships, volunteer positions, etc. if any)
6. Education Section (if any; please only include college/university experiences here)

**If you have no work experience but do have a recent computer science degree OR if you have primarily non-software work experience but do have a recent computer science degree:**

1. Professional Summary Section (optional but encouraged for those with limited experience)
2. Skills Section
3. Education Section
4. Projects Section
5. Other Experience section (such as internships, volunteer positions, etc. if any)
6. Relevant Experience Section

**If you have software development work experience:**

1. Professional Summary Section (optional)
2. Skills Section
3. Work Experience Section
4. Other Experience Section (optional)
5. Projects Section (optional)
6. Education Section

**A note:** depending on the length of your final draft, you may later find yourself adding or deleting optional sections of your resume. That's normal and fine.

### **Post all content in reverse-chronological order**

The most recent experience in every section should always come first, and the oldest experience should always come last. The **only** exception to this is in the Projects section: projects don't necessarily require dates, so you can highlight your most impressive projects first.

### **Use an appropriate number of bullet points per section**

In order to create a thorough, well-balanced resume, each experience should contain a specific number of bullet points. Too few bullet points will make it seem as if you accomplished nothing at a job or internship. Too many bullet points will make it seem as if you don't know how to prioritize your most important work. The number of recommended bullet points will depend on the section.

**Work Experience:** 3 to 5 bullet points per job

**Education** (computer-science or technology degree): 1 to 3 bullet points per degree/certificate. If you have no work experience, you may increase this number to 2-4 bullet points.

**Education** (non-computer science or technology): no bullet points **except** for major awards

**Other Experience** (internships, volunteer positions, etc.): 2 to 4 bullet points per job

**Projects**: 2-4 bullet points **or** 2-4 sentences per project

### **Limit your resume to 1-page in length**

Hiring managers read dozens or hundreds of resumes, and will often immediately reject resumes that are too short or too long. That means properly prioritizing and organizing information to make sure that you keep your resume to the 1-page limit, and potentially adding or deleting optional sections in order to meet that limit.

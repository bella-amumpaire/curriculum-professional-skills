# Why is SAR format so useful?

Interviewers ask behavioral interview questions to learn how you have behaved in previous work
situations. In your answers, employers are looking for examples of your past actions that may be predictors of how you’ll act when you face these situations again. These questions are more open-ended than a “yes-or-no” question and usually ask you to share stories or examples from your previous work situations.

You might say "Well, it's just a story. Why should I bother to put it into a format and then share it when I can just share the story like any other story?"

The answer is SAR format **does more than just communicating a story**. Here is what it does in our
interviews:

- The situation **paints a picture of who you are as a professional**. Being a professional is not only about the core technical skills but also your ability to manage difficult situations around in your work setting. Literally, it describes a scene where you are taking care of things in an office. This is a key interview goal.
- You are not just dropping names and numbers; you are **adding actions and context to them.** This way, they become way more real than your resume and other application materials.
- The **fact that you are willing to go into detail shows that you are open and honest.** Especially if the story sounds less like “bragging” and more like a situation that truly tested your skills.
- Finally, the way you arrived at a conclusion and put your decisions in motion reveals your **thinking process**. This is crucial for many interviewers, who want to understand the *how* as much as the *what*.

SAR format not only helps you prepare for behavioral interviews but also gives you an opportunity
to reflect and know more about yourself.

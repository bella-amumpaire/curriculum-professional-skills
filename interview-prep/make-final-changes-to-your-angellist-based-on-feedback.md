# Make final changes to your Wellfound based on feedback

## **Learning objectives**

- Create a clear, compelling Wellfound profile.

### **Estimated time: .5h**

## **Description**

In this lesson, you'll use the feedback you received from project reviewers during the last review round to make any necessary final changes to your Wellfound profile.

## Why is it important to make one final round of revisions before finalizing your Wellfound profile?

Wellfound is one of the largest startup job boards on the internet, so if you plan on applying to any startups, you'll likely be using Wellfound extensively over the next few months. Every time you apply for a job via Wellfound, your profile is sent directly to hiring managers. In other words, hiring managers will likely be reviewing your Wellfound profile very carefully, very soon.

The purpose of this final revision round is to ensure that neither you nor your project reviewers have missed an error or area of improvement that could potentially prevent you from receiving interview requests from Wellfound hiring managers. It's also intended to catch any errors that may have been accidentally introduced in previous editing processes.

Remember: the effort you invest in creating and refining your Wellfound profile right now is an effort that will be repaid once you start job searching. **Put as much effort as possible into the Wellfound editing process**; your future, newly-employed self will thank you.

## Project Setup

- Open up your Wellfound profile.
- Open the written and numerical feedback from your project reviewer, including any feedback they may have left via video platforms like Loom. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

## Project submission

### Project requirements

- [Make sure that your Wellfound profile meets every requirement of the Wellfound rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZHhPBL8w6tqSlVDOWI4u9kMVCQtxeDDL9aL3j0VQ2iA/edit). If you have followed the [Wellfound curriculum](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/create-the-first-draft-of-your-angellist-profile.md), it should do so automatically.
- Make sure that you have addressed **each and every piece of feedback your project reviewer has given you.** If you skip over too much feedback, your project reviewer may return the project to you as invalid, and you will need to revise it and resubmit it again. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

### **Submission instructions**

- Carefully review **all feedback** given to you by your project reviewer, including both written feedback and verbal feedback they may have given over video platforms like Loom.
- Implement **each piece of feedback**, ensuring that you have not accidentally skipped over anything. If you skip over a piece of feedback on purpose, include an explanation in the submissions form below. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
- Copy/paste the text of your Wellfound into a Google Document and then run the text through a spellcheck and grammar check tool before you submit it, even if you did so previously; it is very common to accidentally introduce new errors when making changes to a piece of text.

# Attend a Pramp behavioral interview

## Learning objectives

- Practice answering behavioral interview questions in a mock interview setting.

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Attend the Pramp behavioral interview

In a previous step, we asked you to set up 2 Pramp interviews. In this exercise, you will attend your Pramp behavioral interview and submit the feedback you receive. 

### Why is feedback from each Pramp interview important?

After each Pramp session, you will receive feedback from your partner on your communication skills, problem-solving skills, strengths, and weaknesses. This information can help you create a plan to improve.

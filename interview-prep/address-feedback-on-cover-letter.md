# Address feedback on cover letter

## **Learning objectives**

- Write a clear, compelling cover letter.

### **Estimated time: 2h**

## **Description**

In this lesson, you'll use the advice and feedback you previously received from project reviewers to address areas of weakness and potential improvements in your cover letter.

## Why is it important to update your cover letter based on feedback?

The cover letter has the potential to be one of the most powerful documents in a job application; it's a chance to tell a story, and as we've said, human beings love stories. But because cover letters can be difficult to write (and because most applicants spend their cover letter regurgitating the contents of their resume, rather than telling a story), it's incredibly important to receive and use feedback in order to improve your cover letter. You will now be using the constructive critique and feedback given to you by project reviewers to locate errors and areas of weaknesses so that you can improve your cover letter even further.

## Project Setup

- Open up your cover letter.
- Open the written and numerical feedback from your project reviewer, including any feedback they may have left via video platforms like Loom. You can find written feedback on your dashboard for each project under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

## Using project reviewer feedback to improve your cover letter

You know the drill: you'll now go through the process of revising your cover letter based on the feedback that you received from your project reviewer. As we've said multiple times, good feedback is invaluable; it's very difficult to accurately identify all of the weaknesses in our own work, so second (and third) opinions can make an incredibly powerful difference in the strength of your cover letter. Now that you've received feedback from project reviewers, you will use that feedback to identify areas of improvement in your cover letter.

If needed, please review the tips below to ensure that you gain the most value possible from the feedback you've receive, and that you're able to implement the feedback efficiently and correctly.

## Project submission

### Project requirements

- [Make sure that your cover letter meets every requirement of the cover letter rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kiQP_QOxy2Opklleet37kCXbB8uRndRPumtfzKtR9N0/edit). If you have followed the [cover letter curriculum](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/write-and-submit-a-customized-cover-letter.md), it should do so automatically.
- Make sure that you have addressed **each and every piece of feedback your project reviewer has given you.** You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

### **Submission instructions**

_Check out this FAQ if you need a refresher on [Google Doc submission best practices](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063156813)_

- Carefully review **all feedback** given to you by your project reviewer, including both written feedback, comments written in the Google Doc, and verbal feedback they may have given over video platforms like Loom.
- Implement **each piece of feedback**, ensuring that you have not accidentally skipped over anything. If you skip over a piece of feedback on purpose, include a comment in your Google Doc explaining why. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
- Before submitting, use a spellcheck and grammar check tool to identify potential errors in your cover letter, even if you did so previously; it is very common to accidentally introduce new errors when making changes to a piece of text.

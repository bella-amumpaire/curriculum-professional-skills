# Selecting locations to add to your Wellfound profile

The Locations field is exactly what it sounds like: a section where you can list locations you're potentially interested in relocating to. If you're interested in perhaps relocating to and working with Norway, for example, you would just type Norway in the text field, and then select the option that pops up. If you'd like to stay within your own city or country, then just type your own city or country name; that's fine, too.

You can add countries, cities, states, regions, or even continents. However, while you can choose as many locations as you'd like, we recommend focusing on between **1-10 of the locations you're most interested in**. You need to input **at least 1 location**, even if it's your own; otherwise, your profile will look incomplete. However, if you input too many locations, it may seem spammy. Limit yourself to no more than 10 locations.

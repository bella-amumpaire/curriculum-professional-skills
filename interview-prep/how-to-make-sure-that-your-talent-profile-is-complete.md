# How to make sure that your Talent Profile is complete

Most of your Talent Profile should be filled out by now, but there are some sections that may still be empty. Review the sections below and make sure that each has been filled to completion.

### **Optional (Identity)**

The **Optional (Identity) Section** is located at the bottom of the **Profile tab**, and allows you to input your pronouns, ethnicity and gender. These fields are used to help companies improve the diversity of their hiring, and are not listed on your public portfolio. Feel free to leave them blank if you do not feel comfortable answering them.

### **Resume/CV**

If you have made updates to your resume, or if you neglected to upload a resume when first opening your Wellfound account, upload your resume here. This section is **required;** hiring managers greatly prefer profiles with an attached resume, so **you must upload your resume to complete this project**.

### **Preferences**

You should have answered most of these questions when first creating your Wellfound account. **Please review them to ensure the information is accurate and up to date**.

Consider including multiple locations, because it can signal that you have a multicultural mindset, that you're open to relocation, and/or that you're flexible with working with companies based all over the world. Also, make sure that you have also clicked the **Open to working remotely** button.

The last question, related to company size, is a new question that you may have not previously filled out, depending on when you created your Wellfound profile. If you have preferences with regards to company size, please select it here. One note: seed-stage companies often have not secured funding yet, so these companies may only pay in equity, not in salary. Unless you have very stable finances, we recommend doing your due diligence before applying to seed-stage companies to ensure that the company would meet your salary requirements.

### **Culture**

Again, you should have answered most of these questions when creating your Wellfound account. **Review them to make sure your answers are up to date.**

**Please answer** the "Which markets are you MOST interested in working in?" question. However, you **do not** have to answer the "Which markets are you NOT willing to work in?" question if you don't want to.

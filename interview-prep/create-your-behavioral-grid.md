IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE ACTIVITY BELOW:

We are currently experiencing a large number of behavioral grid submissions. This means that it may take longer than one week for your grid to be reviewed, but please go ahead and subit the activity as usual. The activity will be reviewed as soon as possible. This feedback will come in handy for activities in future blocks!

# Create your behavioral grid

## Learning objectives

- Answer common behavioral questions in the SAR format.

### **Estimated time**: 3h

## Description

In this project, you will be creating your behavioral grid using one professional position or project to answer four behavioral questions.

**Note** - This project will be reviewed by one of our career coaches. In order to ensure they are able to review it in a timely fashion, please do your best to submit this as soon as possible, and no later than the end of your day Wednesday.

### Why is creating your behavioral grid important?

In any interview where the recruiter is trying to determine whether you will be a good cultural fit for their company, there is a 100% chance that you will be asked behavioral questions. This is because the recruiter is trying to assess your soft skills like communication skills, teamwork skills, leadership skills, etc. This is why it is really important to prepare and practice the most common behavioral questions and you will be doing this during this project.

### Method to use to complete your behavioral grid

You will be using the SAR method to complete your grid. Below is a quick reminder of what the SAR method is:

- [Definition of the SAR method](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/what-does-sar-mean.md)

### How to use the SAR method to create a good behavioral grid

When using the SAR method to answer a behavioral question, whether in your grid or in a real interview, each of your SARs must respect the following criteria:

- Your S (**Situation**) is clear and talks about a specific example.
- The A (**Actions**) you took to solve the situation above are clear.
- The R (**Results**) of your actions taken above, are great and motivate the interviewer to want to hire you.

So to apply the SAR method properly, ask yourself the following questions before you even start writing your SAR:

- What skill is the interviewer trying to find out by asking me this question?
- What situation can I pick and how can I present it effectively?
- How can I talk about my actions effectively?
- How can I share your results effectively?

**The links below are a quick reminder of how to write your SARs effectively:**

### Example of a good behavioral grid

The link below shows an example of a good behavioral grid. Make sure you read through it and see how each SAR is structured and executed before you start this project.

### Project Setup

1. Study the behavioral grid example above to get a better idea of what makes a strong response to behavioral questions. Spend a minute on each story trying to identify which soft skill or technical skill the story is trying to highlight.
2. Open [this Behavioral grid template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10WfzCmmdbyEdY6ztdfaFTosSNZfS-NBww57U6_Y8fIg/edit?usp=sharing) and make your own copy of it by clicking _"File >> Make a Copy"_, and then save the copy to your own Google Drive.
3. Choose your project or position and write the name at the top of each column. We recommend choosing a software project or software job if possible. This project can be from Microverse, or it can be from another software experience.
4. Use the project or position chosen above to complete the behavioral questions asked in the grid, making sure that each answer you give follows the SAR method. **All rows in the grid must be completed before submission.**

## Project Submission

### Project Requirements

- [Make sure that your behavioral grid meets every requirement of the rubric linked here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EARx6VfxiAbqqUrX9FGOFUmw4Rvy1YTQSBMyYJNrHzY/edit?usp=sharing) If you have followed the lesson above, it should do so automatically.

### Submission Instructions

_Check out this FAQ if you need a refresher on [Google Doc submission best practices](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063156813)_

1. Copy and paste the text of each column of your grid into Grammarly to double-check for spelling errors and grammatical issues. Make any changes that Grammarly suggests.
2. Verify that all technologies and proper nouns are correctly capitalized (for example, use "JavaScript" instead of "Javascript", or "Ruby on Rails" instead of "ruby on rails").
3. Make sure that you have shared access to your grid so that **anyone with the link** can leave suggestions.

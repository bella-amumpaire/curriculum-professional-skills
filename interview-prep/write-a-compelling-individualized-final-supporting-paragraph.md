# Write a compelling, individualized final supporting paragraph

### Build a connection to the company (for example, by discussing company goals or values)

Up to this point, you've been making the case for your own expertise and competence (both technical, professional, and otherwise). The third supporting paragraph is an opportunity to discuss how you could use that expertise in the service of the company you're applying to. There are multiple ways of doing this, but some common ones include:

- Mentioning 1-2 of the company's values or goals, in order to show that you've done their research (and so that in the next few sentences, you will be able to discuss how your own goals are aligned)
- Summing up how your experience would be beneficial to the company/role/department.

### Explain why the connection you've just discussed would enable you to fit in well at the company

Now that you have explained why you feel a connection with the company, you need to explain why the company should want to connect with you. There are many ways to do this, but common methods include:

- Explaining why you believe in the importance of the company's mission
- Discussing specific company values you see in yourself, being sure to provide evidence/examples of how you've demonstrated those values
- Explaining why a specific company program or value means so much to you

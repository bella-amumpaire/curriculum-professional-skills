# Finalize your cover letter and submit an application.

## **Learning objectives**

- Write a clear, compelling cover letter.

### **Estimated time: .5h**

## **Description**

In this lesson, you'll use the feedback you received from your previous cover letter reviews to make any remaining edits to your cover letter—**and then you'll use your job materials to submit your application**!

## Why is it important to make one final round of revisions before finalizing and submitting your cover letter?

We've discussed the importance of story-telling in the job application process: we use stories in elevator pitches, in the About Me section of various online profiles, in interviews, and, of course, in cover letters. In fact, many people receive job offers and interviews based less on experience and more on the strength of their ability to tell a compelling story about their experience, strengths, and potential. That's why the cover letter is important, and that's why it's important to undergo one last revision round: to ensure that you're telling the best version of your story that's possible. 

The purpose of this final revision round is to ensure that neither you nor your project reviewers have missed an error or area of improvement that could potentially prevent you from receiving interview requests. It's also intended to catch any errors that may have been accidentally introduced in previous editing processes.  

Remember: the effort you invest in creating and refining your cover letter is an effort that will be repaid once you start job searching—which, since you'll be submitting an application momentary, begins right now. **Put all of your efforts into the cover letter editing process**; your future, newly-employed self will thank you.

## Project Setup

- Open up your cover letter in Google Docs
- Open all written and numerical cover letter feedback from your project reviewer(s), including any feedback you received directly on the Google Doc and/or any video feedback you received over video platforms like Loom. You can find written feedback on your dashboard for each project under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

## Using project reviewer feedback to finalize your cover letter

Please review the article below (for the final time, at least as a requirement!) once more to ensure that you're familiar with these important tips for using feedback to improve your projects. Once done, use the feedback you've received to make final improvements to your cover letter.

## Project submission

### Project requirements

- [Make sure that your cover letter meets every requirement of the cover letter rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kiQP_QOxy2Opklleet37kCXbB8uRndRPumtfzKtR9N0/edit). If you have followed the [cover letter curriculum](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/write-and-submit-a-customized-cover-letter.md), it should do so automatically. 
- Make sure that you have addressed **each and every piece of feedback your project reviewer has given you.** Do not skim their feedback; read it aloud carefully to ensure that you don't miss suggestions. **If you skip over too much feedback, your project reviewer may return the project to you as invalid, and you will need to revise it and resubmit it again, which could delay your progress in the program.** You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
- **Open up the job posting you are applying to**

### **Submission instructions**

*Check out this FAQ if you need a refresher on [Google Doc submission best practices](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063156813)* 

- Carefully review **all feedback** given to you by your project reviewer, including comments and suggestions written directly on the Google Doc and any verbal feedback over video platforms like Loom.
- Implement **each piece of feedback**, ensuring that you have not accidentally skipped over anything. If you skip over a piece of feedback on purpose, include an explanation in the submission form below. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
- Run your document through Grammarly before you submit it, even if you did so previously; it is very common to accidentally introduce new errors when making edits/changes to a piece of text.
- **Once you have completed revisions**, start completing all fields in the job application. Carefully review each field to make sure you have not made any spelling errors. Upload all required documents. 
- **Keep the following note in mind:** Most applications give you the ability to upload your cover letter as its own document, but some don't. If this job application does not have an individual field for a cover letter, then extract both your resume and cover letters as PDF files and then use [a PDF combiner like SmallPDF](https://smallpdf.com/merge-pdf) to merge both documents together, ensuring that your resume comes first.

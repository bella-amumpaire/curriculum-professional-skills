# Write and submit a customized cover letter

## Learning objectives

- Write a clear, compelling cover letter.

### **Estimated time**: 3h

## Description

In this project, we'll walk you through how to create a cover letter that expands upon your resume to paint a thorough picture of who you are as both a potential employee and as a person. This will be your first draft, so it doesn't need to be perfect. Instead, focus on using the curriculum below to write the first draft; later, you'll receive feedback that you'll be able to use to make improvements.

**An important note:** once your cover letter is done, you'll be using it (and the rest of your job application materials) to submit a job application! Be sure to pay careful attention to the curriculum here, **especially our curriculum about personalizing your cover letter for one specific role.**

### Why is a strong cover letter so important?

For as long as human beings have existed, we've told each other stories. Our societies are built on stories, and good stories can help even strangers feel like they already know you. That's the purpose of a cover letter: to tell a story of who you are, why you're a strong job candidate, and why you'd be an exceptional employee. Most cover letters do nothing but summarize a person's job experiences, which wastes the opportunity to talk about what makes you special. A strong cover letter, however, is an opportunity to frame your experiences and professional strengths, and to explain why you would make a better prospective hire than any other job applicant in an application pile. This project will walk you through **how to write a cover letter designed to tell a compelling story that showcases your professional strengths and uniqueness, regardless of your previous experience**.

### Project Setup

1. Build your cover letter in Google Docs. This will allow project reviewers to leave comments and suggestions directly on the document. If you would later like to save your document in another file format (such as a .pdf), Google Docs allows you to export files using multiple file formats.
2. Share your document so that **anyone with the link** can make suggestions. If you do not share access to your cover letter, project reviewers will not have an easy way to provide you with feedback, your cover letter will be **returned to you** without edits, and you may be delayed in your progress in the program.

## Thoroughly fill in the cover letter header

Your cover letter header **is intended to quickly link hiring managers to your online presence: particularly your portfolio, contact information, and professional online profiles**. That way, a hiring manager wonâ€™t have to toggle between documents in order to find a method of contacting you, but instead will always have your name, contact info, and professional links easily accessible.

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Fill out your header with all of the required information listed in the link above.

## Write the introduction paragraph of your cover letter

Your introduction is the first opportunity you have in your cover letter to catch a hiring manager's attention, which means it needs to be both hyper-focused on a specific position and thorough enough to explain why a hiring manager should want to learn more about you. Because of that, each introduction needs to contain some crucial pieces of information. Let's discuss this information below.

**Learn more about the introduction of a cover letter:**

[Write a strong, focused introduction to your cover letter](write-a-strong-focused-introduction-to-your-cover-letter.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Select a company you would like to apply to. This can either be a dream company or a company that has recently posted a job listing on a job board. **Do not** use a placeholder company (like "Company XYZ")**. You must** select a specific, real-world company with a development-related current job opening.
2. Take 5 minutes to pick 1-2 reasons you are excited about applying to **this specific company**, ensuring that your reason(s) is focused enough that it **could not** be used for any company in the world. If needed spend an additional 5-10 minutes doing research, in order to find details to support your reasoning. **Remember that you will be applying to this company at the end of this lesson; the more focused/personalized your introduction, the better.**
3. Take 10-20 minutes to write an introduction using the curriculum above. 

## Plan and write your first supporting paragraph

The first supporting paragraph of your cover letter is intended to introduce a hiring manager to who you are: not simply by discussing your development experience, but also by showcasing and highlighting the skills, professional and personality traits, and/or achievements that would make you a better employee than someone else might be, even if they have more experience than you do. There are several ways to do so, several of which we'll discuss in the content of this lesson.

**Learn more about how to write a compelling, story-centric supporting paragraph:**

[Write your first supporting paragraph](write-your-first-supporting-paragraph.md)

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Take 10 minutes to select a development-related skill or experience you would like to showcase, and to identify 1-3 soft/professional skills that have allowed you to succeed in that development-related skill or experience.
2. Take 20-30 minutes to write your first supporting paragraph.

## Write your second supporting paragraph

Just as your first supporting paragraph is intended to tell a story showcasing your strengths/advantages as a developer, the second supporting paragraph should do the same: explain the skills and traits that have allowed you to succeed in the past, all with the aim of proving that you'd be a stellar employee of the company you're applying to.

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Take 10 minutes to select a different type of skill or experience you would like to showcase, and to identify 1-3 soft/professional skills that have allowed you to succeed in that second skill or experience.
2. Take 20-30 minutes to write your second supporting paragraph.

## Write a third and final supporting paragraph

The purpose of the third and final supporting paragraph is to clearly reiterate why you would be such a strong fit for a specific job or company. There are several ways to do this, some of which we'll discuss in the lesson below. However, the core thing to keep in mind is this: this is the final supporting paragraph that a hiring manager will read, so it's very important to focus it very intensely on highlighting why you and the position you're applying to are such good fits for each other.

**Learn how to wrap up your cover letter with a third supporting paragraph:**

**Apply what you've learned**

1. Spend 10 minutes choosing the value, program, etc. that you would like to use in order to build a connection with the company.
2. Take 20-30 minutes discussing why that value is important to you, or why you would be an especially strong fit at the company/position.

## Write your conclusion paragraph

The conclusion of your cover letter is meant to reiterate your interest in a position, to very briefly summarize why you'd be a good fit, and to increase the possibilities of hearing back with a call to action. In the lesson below, we'll discuss how to do this within a single paragraph.

## Check your cover letter for common errors

Attention to detail is one of the most valuable skills needed for software developers, so it's time to use that skill to review your cover letter for common but damaging errors.

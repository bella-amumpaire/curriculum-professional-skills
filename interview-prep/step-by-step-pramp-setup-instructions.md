# Step-by-step Pramp setup instructions

**Sign Up:** Click the green “Start Practicing. It’s Free!” button to sign up.

You’ll be prompted to enter your first name, last name, email address, and password.

Clicking **Continue** will present you with a screen where you fill out information about yourself. You’ll be asked the following questions: What city do you live in?

- What is your highest level of education?
- Was your degree in a computer science-related field, or in another field?
- How many years of professional development experience do you have?
- What would you consider your current level for job interviewing to be?

You will also be asked whether you’re pursuing a role in software engineering or product management:

Once you answer these questions, you’ll be invited to choose a type of interview. There are six types of interviews you can choose from:

- **Data Structures and Algorithm**: practice questions asked by real companies in phone screens and on-site interviews, using code execution and test cases and video chat.
- **Behavioral**: practice behavioral interview questions, covering topics such as describing your recent professional experience, workplace challenges, teamwork skills, and more!
- **System Design**: practice system design questions covering topics such as API design, scaling, performance, data modeling, network architecture, and more.
- **Frontend**: practice frontend interview topics across the stack, from layout and visual design using HTML and CSS, to JavaScript and DOM manipulation fundamentals.
- **Applied Data Science**: practice the process of translating a business problem into a mathematical one, applying data science skills in real-time, over video with talented peers.
- **Practice with a Friend**: want to practice with a friend? Send out an invite, and jump straight into a collaborative session, using video and code execution.

At this point, you’ll be sent an email confirmation. You must navigate to your inbox and click on the **Activate Your Pramp Account** email you just received. Then click on **verify email address.**

You will again be asked to click on an interview type. After doing so, you’ll be presented with a calendar.

One thing you’ll notice is that some of these time slots are flagged in green, others in yellow, and some are not flagged at all. **Green flags** indicate a very strong match: someone who matches well with your background and skill set and will likely give you a great interview experience. **Yellow flags** indicate a nice match: someone who may not be quite as good of a fit, but who should still be able to give you a good interview experience. **No flags** indicate a mediocre interview fit; someone who may or may not give you a good interview experience.

Wherever possible, prioritize green flags first, yellow flags second, and no flags last.

Once you click a time slot, you will immediately be matched.

You will then be taken to your dashboard, where you can start a practice session, add the interview session to your calendar, review the set of questions you’ll ask, and reschedule or cancel the session.

Five minutes before your scheduled session, Pramp will email you a link that will take you to the online interview platform. When you arrive to your platform, it will look like this demo version below:

The default language is set to Java, but by clicking the language you can choose between 12 different options. You can toggle the text editor with video by clicking the video button directly to the left of the text editor. On the left side of the screen, you will see the question. You can also view hints and the answer by clicking each tab.

**Adjusting Skills and Settings**

After logging in, you’ll see a few links at the upper right side of the screen. The link on the very right will be your name. After clicking on it, you’ll be given the option to log out, test your camera and microphone, and adjust your settings.

Your **Settings** page is where you’ll be able to change any information you gave when you first signed up (such as your name, city, and interview skill level). It’s also where you’ll be able to specify any areas of expertise, and which programming languages you can interview in. The options are as follows:

Areas of expertise: Frontend, Backend, iOS, Android, Data Science, DevOps, Management, Kernel, Security, Machine Learning, Big Data, Test Automation.

Programming Languages: Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, C, C#, Swift, Ruby, PHP, Go, Clojure, and Haskell.

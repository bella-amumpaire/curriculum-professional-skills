# Write a conclusion to your cover letter

### Reiterate your interest in the position

It's standard to end the cover letter with a brief sentence reiterating your interest in the position, and it may not be a strict requirement, omitting this sentence can seem strange. A brief sentence along the lines of "I'm very excited about the possibility of working for [company name] and I hope to speak with you further about the opportunity" would be sufficient.

### Conclude with a call to action

We've mentioned calls to action (CTA) repeatedly while discussing elevator pitches and LinkedIn profiles, and that's because they're an incredibly valuable marketing tool. A good CTA is used to open the door for continuing conversation, and to reiterate your interest.

### Give a polite farewell, followed by your name

Now that you've explained why you would be a good fit for the position, it's time to end the cover letter by thanking the reader for their time and wishing them farewell. This requirement ensures that the cover letter does not stop abruptly, but that it ends naturally with a short goodbye.

# Write a second supporting paragraph

### Briefly discuss a second (and different) development qualification

The second supporting paragraph should lay out another piece of evidence that will support your claims of being a strong software developer. This should not simply repeat the claim made in the first supporting paragraph; for example, if the first supporting paragraph discusses an app you've built, the second supporting paragraph shouldn't simply discuss a different app; it should discuss a professional skill you've displayed or something else in your past that that will set you up for success.

Note: while your first supporting paragraph should clearly discuss development-related experience, your second supporting paragraph does not have to be strictly development-related.  If you don't have professional development experience, you can instead discuss achievements from previous, non-software positions.

### Use the biographical information/development qualifications you've just discussed in order to provide evidence of your soft/professional skills

Just as the first supporting paragraph tells a story to make a case for a student's development-related qualifications, the second should do the same. Once the second supporting paragraph as been "set up" with your claim (for example, a claim that you thrive in fast-paced, startup-type environments), this paragraph should then attempt to prove that claim (for example, by explaining how you successfully juggled multiple client accounts at their previous job, or by giving examples of your success during the fast-paced nature of Microverse).

### Clearly connect your soft skills to your strength as a developer or job candidate

Because the cover letter is meant to be development-oriented, you need to make it completely clear that the story you've told in the second supporting paragraph is meant to showcase skills that would be useful to you as an employee or developerâ€”*especially* if you're discussing a story that may not be strictly development-related. As mentioned previously, this can be done implicitly--for example, if you've specifically mentioned your skills with debugging code, it's obvious that debugging is a development-related skill. If the skill is not immediately, obviously development-related, however (for example, if you're discussing a soft skill like your continuous desire to learn), the connection should be stated explicitly (for example, by explaining that this desire to learn has helped you pick up a number of frameworks and languages, which has served you well as a developer).

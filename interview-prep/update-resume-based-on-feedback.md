# Update resume based on feedback

## **Learning objectives**

- Create a strong resume that will pass applicant tracking systems.

### **Estimated time: 1h**

## **Description**

In this lesson, you'll use the feedback you received from project reviewers to further improve your resume.

## Why is it important to update your resume based on feedback?

Your resume is a carefully-curated persuasive document designed to showcase the very best of your achievements, and even the most talented software developers struggle with crafting a strong one. Using the curriculum, you've created a resume that will highlight many of your strengths. It's difficult to create a perfect resume on your first try, though, so we'll now be using the constructive critique and feedback given to you by project reviewers to locate errors and areas of weaknesses so that we can improve our resume further. 

This step of the resume writing process is used to further refine and polish your resume so that you'll have the best chance possible of impressing the hiring managers who read it.

## Project Setup

- Open up your resume in Google Docs.
- Open the written and numerical feedback from your project reviewer, including any feedback they may have written directly on the Google Doc. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

## Using project reviewer feedback to improve your resume

We've repeatedly discussed the importance and value of good feedback, and you should now recognize how necessary feedback is to the revision process. Just as your code will periodically undergo code reviews and quality control as a software developer, your professional skills projects will also undergo project reviews. You will now be expected to use this feedback to identify areas of improvement in your resume.

Please review the helpful tips below to ensure that you gain the most value from the feedback you receive, and that you're able to implement the feedback efficiently and correctly.

## Project submission

### Project requirements

- [Make sure that your resume meets every requirement of the resume rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lxBFRdvPW_cLQpX8n_gj8O8t1XPcXjGTDOCI813Uga0/edit). If you have followed the [resume curriculum](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/create-the-first-draft-of-your-resume.md), it should do so automatically.
- Make sure that you have addressed **each and every piece of feedback your project reviewer has given you.** If you skip over too much feedback, your project reviewer may return the project to you as invalid, and you will need to revise it and resubmit it again. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

### **Submission instructions**

*Check out this FAQ if you need a refresher on [Google Doc submission best practices](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063156813)* 

- Carefully review **all feedback** given to you by your project reviewer, including comments and suggestions written directly on the Google Doc.
- Implement **each piece of feedback**, ensuring that you have not accidentally skipped over anything. If you skip over a piece of feedback on purpose, include an explanation in the submissions form below. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
- Run your document through a spellcheck and grammar check tool before you submit it, even if you did so previously; it is very common to accidentally introduce new errors when making changes to a piece of text.

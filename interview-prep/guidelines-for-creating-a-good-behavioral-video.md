# Guidelines for creating a good behavioral video

- Make sure the room you are in is bright enough for you to be seen easily in the camera.

- Test your audio and camera before you start recording to make sure you communicate and present yourself well.
- Make sure you look professional in your video - have a nice shirt or a nice dress on (no need to put on a suit!).
- Make sure your background is organized and there is no clutter behind you. The attention should be on you and only you.
- When you start the video, you can start by saying *"Hi, my name is XXX and the first behavioral question I am going to answer is....".*
- Make sure every answer you give follows the SAR method.
- When you speak, try to maintain a good pace of speaking. Try not to speak too slow or too fast.
- Try to have a friendly and professional attitude while recording.

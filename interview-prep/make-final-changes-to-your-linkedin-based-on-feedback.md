# Make final changes to your LinkedIn based on feedback

## **Learning objectives**

- Create a clear, compelling LinkedIn page.

### **Estimated time: .5h**

## **Description**

In this lesson, you'll use the feedback you received from project reviewers during the last review round to make final changes your LinkedIn profile.

## Why is it important to make one final round of revisions before finalizing your LinkedIn profile?

As we've mentioned before, your LinkedIn is an extremely powerful tool: it works as a combination of your resume, elevator pitch, and project portfolio, and a strong LinkedIn profile can be the difference between recruiter outreach/interview requests and no response at all. You've previously used the curriculum and project revision process to build a strong, compelling LinkedIn profile, but before you officially complete this project, you'll undergo one final round of revisions.

The purpose of this final revision round is to ensure that neither you nor your project reviewers have missed an error or area of improvement that could potentially prevent you from receiving interview requests. It's also intended to catch any errors that may have been accidentally introduced in previous editing processes.

Remember: the effort you invest in creating and refining your LinkedIn profile right now is an effort that will be repaid once you start job searching. **Put as much effort as possible into the LinkedIn editing process**; your future, newly-employed self will thank you.

## Project Setup

- Open up your LinkedIn profile.
- Open the written and numerical feedback from your project reviewer, including any feedback they may have left via video platforms like Loom. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

## Project submission

### Project requirements

- [Make sure that your LinkedIn profile meets every requirement of the LinkedIn rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MHmt3Vx4SRHa7z8PuoUiYg9eLakpi1qGPT6868bacGc/edit). If you have followed [the LinkedIn curriculum](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/create-first-draft-of-a-professional-linkedin-page.md), it should do so automatically.
- Make sure that you have addressed **each and every piece of feedback your project reviewer has given you.** If you skip over too much feedback, your project reviewer may return the project to you as invalid, and you will need to revise it and resubmit it again. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

### **Submission instructions**

- Carefully review **all feedback** given to you by your project reviewer, including both written feedback and verbal feedback they may have given over video platforms like Loom.
- Implement **each piece of feedback**, ensuring that you have not accidentally skipped over anything. If you skip over a piece of feedback on purpose, include an explanation in the submissions form below. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
- Copy/paste the text of your LinkedIn into a Google Document and then run the text through a spellcheck and grammar check tool before you submit it, even if you did so previously; it is very common to accidentally introduce new errors when making changes to a piece of text.

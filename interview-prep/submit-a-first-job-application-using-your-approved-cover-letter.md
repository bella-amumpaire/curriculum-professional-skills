# Submit a job application using your approved cover letter


### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise

Right now, you should have a set of application materials ready, including a cover letter created for a job position. In this exercise, you will submit them to familiarize yourself with the process of submitting applications.

### Instructions

**Work through this exercise once your cover letter has been approved by a reviewer.**

1. Open the job application and complete all fields in the job application. Carefully review each field to ensure you have not made any spelling errors. Upload all required documents. 
2. **Keep the following note in mind:** Most applications allow you to upload your cover letter as its own document, but some don't. If this job application does not have an individual field for a cover letter, extract your resume and cover letters as PDF files and then use [a PDF combiner like SmallPDF](https://smallpdf.com/merge-pdf) to merge both documents together, ensuring that your resume comes first.
3. Register in the exercise template information about the job position that you applied to, and links to the resume and cover letter that you sent.

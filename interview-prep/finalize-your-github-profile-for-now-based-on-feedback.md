# Finalize your GitHub profile (for now) based on feedback

## **Learning objectives**

- Prepare a strong GitHub profile.

### **Estimated time: .5h**

## **Description**

In this lesson, you'll use the feedback you received from project reviewers to make final improvements and revisions to your GitHub profile.

## Why is it important to make one last round of revisions before finalizing your GitHub profile?

Now that you've gone through the curriculum and revision process, your GitHub is likely much stronger than it was when you first began working on this project. However, before you officially complete this project, you'll undergo one final round of revisions.

The purpose of this final revision round is to ensure that neither you nor your project reviewers have missed an error that could potentially raise a red flag for a recruiter or hiring manager. It's also intended to catch any errors that may have been accidentally introduced in previous editing rounds.

Remember: the effort you invest into refining your GitHub profile is an effort that will be repaid once you start applying for jobs (and potentially even beforehand, once recruiters start visiting your GitHub). **Put all of your effort into this editing process**; your future, newly-employed self will thank you.

## Project Setup

- Log in to your GitHub account.
- Open all written and numerical GitHub profile feedback from your project reviewer(s). You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.

## Using project reviewer feedback to finalize your GitHub profile

As we've mentioned previously, the ability to willingly accept feedback and then use that feedback to improve your projects is a valuable skill. This skill will serve you for the rest of your life, and is a skill that will help set you apart from other job applicants and colleagues.

Please review the article below once more to ensure that you've memorized our most important tips for using feedback to improve your projects. Once done, you'll be able to use all of the feedback you've received to finalize your GitHub.

## Project submission

### Project requirements

- [Make sure that your GitHub profile meets every requirement of the GitHub rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A1x6Vqm6rmChKkb3T3IXBWRNyygTZ2oiHCPZq4IrXT4/edit). If you have followed the [GitHub curriculum](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/becoming-a-remote-professional/create-the-first-draft-of-a-professional-looking-github-profile-page.md), it should do so automatically.
- Make sure that you have addressed **each and every piece of feedback your project reviewer has given you.** Do not skim their feedback; read it aloud carefully to ensure that you don't miss suggestions. If you skip over too much feedback, your project reviewer may return the project to you as invalid, and you will need to revise it and resubmit it again. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
- **Remember that this will be your final revision round for your GitHub profile until you reach the end of Microverse**. If you rush through the feedback process, any remaining errors or areas of improvement could potentially be left remaining on your public GitHub for months. If recruiters or hiring managers stumble upon your GitHub profile in the meantime, those errors could mean missing out on job opportunities you might otherwise have been qualified for. The effort you put into your GitHub profile today is an investment; invest that effort wisely.

### **Submission instructions**

- Carefully review **all feedback** given to you by your project reviewer.
- Implement **each piece of feedback**, ensuring that you have not accidentally skipped over anything. If you skip over a piece of feedback on purpose, include an explanation in the submissions form below. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
- Run all text on your GitHub profile (including project descriptions, personal README text, and your bio) through a spellcheck and grammar check tool before you submit it, even if you did so previously; it is very common to accidentally introduce new errors when making edits/changes to a piece of text.

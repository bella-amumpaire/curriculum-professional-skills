# How to frame and share actions correctly?

This part of your answer requires the most in-depth description as this is what largely indicates your fitness for a role. Identify and discuss a few of the most impactful steps you took to find success.

Often, workplace challenges are addressed by a team; however, it’s a **common pitfall to use the word “we” to describe how you achieved your goals during an interview**. In any case, it’s important to focus on what you did in the situation. It can be helpful to remember that the employer’s intention is to hire you for the role rather than your team, so you should **use the word “I” to highlight your particular contributions**. 

Remember that the **action should sound realistic**: you are not meant to be the only smart person in the room. Rather, emphasize **how you arrived at a solution** by understanding the situation.

Let's take two examples to highlight the above-mentioned points. The example questions are the same as used in the situation part. 

Example 1: **Describe a time when you were under a lot of pressure at work. How did you react?**

**Sample response for the situation:** In my last internship, one of my co-workers quit immediately after signing the biggest client our firm had ever taken on.

Although I was already working on a project, I was assigned this new client as well. I knew the stakes were high and if we lost this deal, then we wouldn’t hit our quarterly goal.

**Sample response for the action:** I first took some measures to destress. Then I carefully evaluated and restructured my task list to make sure I could manage all my duties. Because of this, I was able to make myself completely available to the client. I also sacrificed some evenings and weekends to take calls until the project was delivered.

Example 2: **What major problems have you encountered while working with a team member, and how did you deal with them?**

**Sample response for the situation:** In one of my internships, I had a team member who was working along with me on designing a product.  One day, I got to know that this team member has been sharing stories that weren't true behind my back. 

**Sample response for the action:** I feel that the best way to deal with any challenges is to meet them head-on. I knew it would be a difficult conversation and might sound like blame. Rather than increasing the tension, I decided to approach my team member directly to talk about what I had heard.

# Time booked for implementing suggested project changes

Each professional skills project at Microverse will get a review. Your professional skills reviewer will likely ask you to make changes to your project, so you will probably need some time to analyze the feedback that you receive and implement the suggested changes after each review.

**Therefore, you can see time booked to make changes for each professional skills project in the Student Dashboard.**

If you need to refresh yourself regarding this review process, you can check the article [How to ask for a professional skills review at Microverse](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/how-to-ask-for-a-prof-skills-review-v2.md).

### Why is it important to update your professional skills project based on feedback?

As we've mentioned, very few people are capable of creating perfect first drafts of anything; we all make mistakes, and we can all benefit from a constructive critique. By listening to and analyzing feedback from others, we're then able to identify our areas of weakness, and potentially come up with new ideas for how to improve them.

The professional skills review process considers a maximum of three rounds of revision to help you further refine and polish your application materials so that you'll have the best chance possible of moving forward in any application process.

### Using project reviewer feedback to improve your GitHub profile

As a software developer, your code will periodically undergo code reviews and quality control; this is normal and is a powerful way of helping us learn more and improve on our projects. In a similar way, project reviewers will review your professional skills projects, such as your elevator pitch, and professional profiles, among others, to help you identify areas where you have the opportunity to further improve on your work.

In the link below, we'll discuss a few helpful tips to ensure that you gain the most value from the feedback you receive and that you're able to implement the feedback efficiently and correctly. We previously shared this link, but it's important to review it before each round of the feedback process to ensure that you're in the best editorial mindset possible.

### How should you use the time booked for making project changes?

We give you flexibility in that matter, so use the time as it best fits your schedule. We recommend:

- To check periodically if your project has been reviewed in your Dashboard: the status of the activity will change to “Approved” or “Changes requested”.
- Whenever you see that changes have been requested, allot some time to modify your project accordingly and submit it for another review.
- Carefully review **all feedback** given to you by your project reviewer.
- Implement **each piece of feedback**, ensuring that you have not accidentally skipped over anything. Read it aloud carefully to ensure that you don't miss suggestions. You can find written feedback for each project on your dashboard under the **Action—>View Reviews** button.
- Run all text on your project through a spellcheck and grammar check tool before you submit it, **even if you did so previously**; it is very common to accidentally introduce new errors when making edits/changes to a piece of text.
- Always mind the deadlines! Identify when your project is due to plan your work. Remember that:
  - “Core requirement” activities are due by the end of the week and have to be approved by Saturday 11:59 to avoid a block repetition.
  - In the case of carry-over activities, you get an additional week to complete them. The week they are due, they will appear at the top of your View Progress Page to help you identify them.
- Occasionally, you might need to go through another round of review and changes to get your project approved.

### What should you do if you need more time for project changes than the amount booked for that?

The time booked for the project changes is an estimate, so it is ok if it occasionally takes you longer to complete a project. We expect the average student to be able to generally complete their Microverse required work during program time, but potentially you can spend 5-15 hours a week doing extracurricular work. However, if you need significantly more time on a specific project than estimated definitely let us know about it by reaching out to us through your Student Dashboard.

### What should you do about the time booked for the project changes in the Student Dashboard?

There is no need to submit any product for this activity: simply mark it as complete in your Dashboard.

You must make project changes and then request the necessary reviews for the project to receive final approval. This may take the amount of time listed in the Student Dashboard, but because that amount of time is just an estimate, your project changes may take more or less time than the time estimate provided in the Student Dashboard.

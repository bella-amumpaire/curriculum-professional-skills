# Displaying attention to detail and English ability by reducing errors

### **Spelling**

There are two steps to take in order to check spelling:

1. Use Google Docs' spellchecker. If spellcheck isn't automatically turned on as a default, click **Tools >> Spelling and Grammar > Spelling and Grammar Check**.
2. Read your resume aloud! Spellcheck won't catch instances of the wrong word being used if that word is spelled correctly (for example, if you accidentally type "world" instead of "word"). Reading your resume aloud uses a different part of your brain, and will help you identify those errors.

### **Grammar**

To catch grammar errors, follow these 3 steps:

- Use Google Doc's grammar check. Again, click **Tools >> Spelling and Grammar > Spelling and Grammar Check**. You may have done this in the previous step, but if you skipped grammar errors, be sure to check again.
- Read your resume aloud! Even if you're an ESL speaker, reading your resume aloud may help you locate errors that you didn't notice while writing them.
- Use Grammarly's grammar check. You should have already downloaded the Grammarly extension, and Grammarly may already be turned on for you. Make sure that the Google Docs option is toggled on in the extension.

### **Sentence tense**

Use the scenarios below to identify which sentence tense is correct:

If you're talking about a previous job, position, etc: **Use past tense (**for example,  "deliver**ed** X," "revamp**ed** Y," "design**ed** Z"). There are no exceptions. "

If you're talking about something you already accomplished at a current job, position, etc.: **Use past tense (**for example,  "deliver**ed** X," "revamp**ed** Y," "design**ed** Z"). There are no exceptions.

If you're talking about something you are **in the middle of doing** at a current job, position, etc.: **Use present continuous tense** (for example,  "deliver**ing** X," "revamp**ing** Y," "design**ing** Z").

If you've made changes to sentence tenses, be sure to use Google Doc's grammar tool and Grammarly one more time, just in case you accidentally introduced an error.

### **Sentence clarity**

Sentence clarity is probably the most difficult aspect of English, and if you speak English as a second (or third) language, you may struggle with this. Don't worry: Microverse's project reviewers and career coaches will help you improve sentence clarity when they review your resume. However, there are still some steps you should take on your own to improve clarity:

- Ask your standup team (especially English as a Second Language speakers) to review your resume, and ask them if there are any sentences that confuse them. If so, try to make those sentences simpler and shorter.
- [Use Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) to identify sentences that are longer than 25 words. **Focus on the red highlights** (don't worry too much about the other colors). It's okay if you have a few longer sentences, but if more than 25% of your sentences are 25+ words, shorten them.
- Again, read sentences aloud.

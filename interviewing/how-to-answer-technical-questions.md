# How to answer technical questions

## Learning objectives

- Practice answering technical interview questions in a mock interview setting.
- Communicate clearly and effectively in spoken English.
- Communicate technical concepts to other technical people.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5h

## Description

When asked a technical question, are you able to communicate your understanding with ease? If the answer is no, this lesson is for you!

In this lesson, you will practice your **technical articulation skills**. You will do so by practicing with a peer in a "mock interview"-type setting.

### Why should you practice your articulation

Articulation, also known as **the expression of ideas in an easy-to-understand manner**, is useful for many reasons:

- It helps to transfer knowledge to other team members
- You'll be better understood by peers with different roles (i.e. fellow engineers, project managers)
- Articulation helps to be more influential when you want to spread your ideas

The good thing is that it's a skill in itself that can be improved!

### The structure of a good answer

A good answer consists of the following components (in order):

1. ❓Clarification - Ask the interviewer to clarify the terms used
2. 📖 Definition - Give a definition of the concept
3. 🏞 Example - Provide a common use case or personal experience
4. 🤔 Opinion - Share your thoughts about the usefulness of the concept.

Imagine you're asked the following question:

> "What is web storage?"

Most people would jump right to the definition and then leave it there:

> "Web storage is a browser-based storage solution (like localStorage or sessionStorage) that allows a client to store non-sensitive data."

This is necessary part of the answer, but not enough to show the interviewer what you're capable of. Here's a more complete answer:

```md
(❓Clarification) What is meant with “web”? I.e frontend, web app or else?

(📖 Definition) In the context of web storage, `web` usually refers to the “browser“. With “storage” we refer to the location within browser where we can store (stringified) data. This is why it’s also known as “client-side storage”. The main reason it is used is because it allows a client to store non-sensitive data persistently."

(🏞 Example) An example of modern web storage is `local storage` and `session storage`. Local storage is persistent (which means the data remains across sessions), while session storage is session-specific. Use cases: shopping cart, quiz.

(🤔 Opinion) 1 pro of this approach is that we can quickly store and retrieve data without having to send an HTTP request to the server. 1 con is that we can’t store any sensitive data, so we would need send a POST request to a database.
```

Which answer is a better display of expertise? Probably the second one!

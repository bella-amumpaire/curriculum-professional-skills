### Why is it important to update your professional skills project based on feedback?

As we've mentioned, very few people are capable of creating perfect first drafts of anything; we all make mistakes, and we can all benefit from constructive critique. By listening to and analyzing feedback from others, we're then able to identify our areas of weakness, and potentially come up with new ideas for how to improve them.

### Using peer feedback to improve your application materials

As a software developer, your code will periodically undergo code reviews and quality control; this is normal and is a powerful way of helping us learn more and improve on our projects. In a similar way, your peers (and you as well!) will review your professional skills projects, such as your elevator pitch, and professional profiles, among others, to help you identify areas where you have the opportunity to further improve on your work. 

In the link below, we'll discuss a few helpful tips to ensure that you gain the most value from the feedback you receive and that you're able to implement the feedback efficiently and correctly. We previously shared this link, but it's important to review it before each round of the feedback process to ensure that you're in the best editorial mindset possible.


### Instructions 

The peer review process follows the following steps:
- Meet with your learning partner in the Zoom meeting.
- Exchange your elevator pitches.
    - Share the link to the doc with your elevator pitch with your partner.
    - Get the link to your learning partner's elevator pitch.
- Review your partner's submission:
    - [Make sure that your partner's elevator pitch meets every requirement of the elevator pitch rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ULe_jeJfj38Pm_Aj_jqVkUVyL8E-dJn6inLB1ITcUF8/edit). If you have followed the curriculum above, it should do so automatically.
    - Leave feedback as [comments in the Google doc](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/65129?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#zippy=%2Cadd-a-comment).
- Come back to your own submission to make changes based on feedback.
    - Carefully review **all feedback** given to you by your learning partner.
    - Implement **each piece of feedback**, ensuring that you have not accidentally skipped over anything. Read it aloud carefully to ensure that you don't miss suggestions.

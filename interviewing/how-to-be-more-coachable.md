# **How to be more coachable**

Learning from others is an essential aspect of personal and professional growth. One way is to get **coaching** from others. The degree that you benefit from others' advice to improve your performance is called **coachability**.

## Being coachable in job interviews

In job interviews, especially, you want to be coachable. This is because it demonstrates to the employer that you are:

- Open to feedback
- Willing to learn and grow
- Able to adapt to new situations

This is seen as a positive attribute because it suggests that the candidate will be able to **effectively integrate into the company culture** and **perform well in the role**. Additionally, having a coachable attitude can lead to personal and professional development, which can have long-term benefits for both the employee and the employer.

## 5 Tips to becoming more coachable

So, how do you actually improve your coachability? Here are **5 tips** to help get you started.

### Tip 1: Embrace a growth mindset

One of the keys to being coachable is having a **growth mindset**.

This is a belief that **you can change**, as well as recognizing that growth is a process, not a destination. Adopting a growth mindset allows you to **view coaching as an opportunity for learning and personal development**, rather than criticism or attack.

### Tip 2: Be open to feedback

Being coachable requires **being open to feedback**, both positive and negative. This means:

- Being willing to listen to what the coach has to say
- Considering their perspective
- Incorporating their feedback into your growth plan.

The last point is crucial, as it is the actual demonstration of being open to feedback; by actually applying it directly.

### Tip 3: Practice active listening

To be coachable, it is crucial to **practice active listening**.

This means fully engaging with the coach, paying attention to what they are saying, and **asking questions to clarify any misunderstandings**. By actively listening, you will be able to understand and incorporate the coach's feedback more effectively.

### Tip 5: Be honest with yourself

To be coachable, you must be honest with yourself about your strengths and weaknesses. Recognize your limitations and be willing to work on them. Seek out coaching in areas where you need the most help and be honest with your coach about what you hope to achieve.

## Examples of coachability

To make this concrete, let's take a look at some **bad and good examples of coachability**.

### Bad examples

> Question: "Have you ever tried doing this differently? Like in manner XYZ?"

> Answer: _"No, I've always done things like this. I believe it works well for me, because..."_

This is an example of not being coachable because it shows **inflexibility**. This could indicate a lack of adaptability and a rigid mindset.

> Question: "Have you ever heard of XYZ? It might revolutionize the ways we work."

> Answer: _"I don't think it's relevant. In technology, we always work in Scrum and it works well."_

In this example, the person is **being dismissive**, which shows a lack of interest in learning and improving.

> Question: "Could you explain why you believe this approach works well?

> Answer: _"Of course it works. I've tried it many times and it works. You just do XYZ"_

In this example, the person is not really addressing the question. Instead, they are **defensive** and feel a need to justify themselves.

### Good examples

> Question: "Have you ever tried doing this differently? Like in manner XYZ?"

> Answer: _"I haven't tried it in manner XYZ, but it's an interesting approach. Let me try it right now..."_

This is a good example of being coachable because the person is showing **genuine interest** and a **willingness to learn**. This indicates that the person is curious and engaged.

> Question: "Have you ever heard of XYZ? It might revolutionize the ways we work."

> Answer: _"I don't know it, but I can imagine why it might! For example, XYZ."_

Here the person is showing the ability to **look at things from another perspective**. This indicates that the person is open-minded and able to think creatively.

> Question: "Could you explain why you believe this approach works well?

> Answer: _"There could be other approaches that work well too. However, I chose this approach because of XYZ"_

This answer shows the person understands that **there is more than one solution** to any problem. This indicates humility and thoughtfulness.

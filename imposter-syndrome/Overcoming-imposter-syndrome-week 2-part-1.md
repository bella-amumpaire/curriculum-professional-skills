# Morning session: Overcoming imposter syndrome: part 2.1

## Learning objectives :

- Continue expanding toolkit for recognizing and overcoming imposter syndrome.

### **Estimated time**: 0.5h

## Description

In this lesson, you will do a quiz to consolidate the information you learned from watching the videos on imposter syndrome last week.

### Why is this important?

When we learn that almost everyone experiences imposter syndrome, we also learn that the doubts that we have are perfectly normal and don't define our potential or intelligence. Almost everyone learning how to code has run into the moment where they struggled so much that they felt like giving up. Once we learn that everyone experiences those thoughts, we know that these doubts and worries do not define us. They are merely part of the learning process and we have to trust that one day we will look back at ourselves and realize we have learned more than we could have imagined.

To achieve that, we have to overcome imposter syndrome. This quiz will help you connect the stories of the people you heard last week with the knowledge you've previously learned at Microverse and help you turn it into action.

# The impacts of imposter syndrome and how to deal with it

### It closes the door to opportunities for you

This is the biggest impact of imposter syndrome. Once you start believing these negative emotions that come from imposter syndrome, they influence your behavior and you start to behave negatively with your peers, interviewers, and employers. This becomes a vicious cycle as people will start to sense your negativity and try to avoid you as much as possible.

### It creates demotivation which leads to lack of progress

You don't feel like doing anything! You don't feel like pursuing your goal anymore and you feel stuck and lost. This, in turn, will reduce your progress and draw you farther away from  achieving your goal.

### It stops you from asking for help

The belief that you should already know something by now stops you from asking for help and this, in turn, stops you from learning from others and growing. The only way to grow in life is to be a life-long student who learns constantly from others and imposter syndrome can stop you from achieving this growth when you don't ask for help.

## Will I ever stop imposter syndrome?

No, imposter syndrome happens to many of us and recurs frequently as we face challenges and grow. The good news is that we can control it and make sure it doesn't stop us from making progress. Below, we will show you some tips on how to tackle imposter syndrome so that it is beneficial to you rather than detrimental.

## How to tackle imposter syndrome

### Accept the current situation

Realize that it is normal for you to experience ups and downs when you are learning something new. Learning to code takes time and a **lot** of practice so it is impossible to know everything at the first try. Even senior developers struggle with basic concepts despite the number of years of experience they have. Learning to code requires time, practice, and patience so remember to be kind to yourself along the way in your coding journey.

Also, remember that your peer who understands the code quicker than you might already have previous experience or some other differences you may not know, which are helping them move faster. Even though it is human to want to compare yourself to your peers, accept that you have different backgrounds, different experiences, and accept that you do not know everything right now and this is OK. Accept that you are still learning and that learning is a life-long process, no matter how fast or slow the process is taking.

### **Remind yourself that you were selected out of thousands to study at Microverse!**

You did not trick anyone. Don’t doubt that the team who selected you, have reviewed your work, and are supporting you all the way see something special in you. The team has made deliberate choices based on the work you put in and your potential. If they saw it, others can see it too. You deserve a pat on the back.

### Adopt a growth mindset

A growth mindset is a way of thinking that believes success is obtained by developing your abilities through dedication and hard work, learning from your mistakes, and reiterating over and over again till you get the result you want. A fixed mindset believes that since I don't know it now, I am not good enough and I will never know it. Having a growth mindset means thinking that intelligence is something you can grow, not something you're born with.

Adopt a growth mindset over a fixed one. Life is continuous growth and so a growth mindset is the best way to adapt to life. The challenges you face today will help shape your victories of tomorrow. This is why whenever you face a challenge, you need to use it as a push to grow and continue striving towards your goal.

You will continue to learn more about growth mindset as you go through the Microverse curriculum as this is a very important tool for your mental and professional growth.

### Ask for help

Asking for help is **not** a weakness. Asking for help is a sign that you are willing to grow and take care of your future. It means that you are willing to invest in your own development and do whatever it takes to reach your goal and this requires energy and dedication. Asking for help is a strength and an important professional skill to develop.

### Get inspiration from others

Have you seen someone you admire achieve the goal you want? Use their stories as an inspiration to keep you going through those challenging, doubtful moments.

- Did you know that Steve Jobs felt like an imposter when he was removed from his own company Apple and still he went on to create Pixar?
- Did you know that Arnold Schwarzenegger was told that he would never be an actor because of his German accent and his strange name?
- Did you know that Maya Angelou said "They will find out I am a fraud" after writing 7 books and winning several awards?
- Did you know that J.K Rowling almost gave up when she was sitting alone in a bar writing Harry Potter on paper napkins?

All these people and more struggled with imposter syndrome and still persisted in following their goals and dreams. Take inspiration from them and from others you admire.

### **Talk to your mentor**

Once you’ve identified that you are experiencing imposter syndrome, talk to your mentor about it. Your mentor will point out that those feelings and fears are irrational, and they will remind you of your strengths. Your mentor has most likely felt the same way, either with coding or with interviewing, or with job searching so it's a great option to use when you start feeling the syndrome.

### **Take a risk**

What would you do differently to reach your goals of getting your next development job if you weren’t afraid? Write it down, tell your standup team, your mentor, and do it. The worst that could happen is that it wouldn’t work. Keep the work going and hold your chin up. Don’t let imposter syndrome keep you from getting what’s yours.

### Write down your accomplishments

The brain has a naughty tendency to focus only on what is not going well. Make a habit of writing down your accomplishments which can help you internalize confidence. It also serves as a good reminder of what the facts are for when you start feeling less confident about yourself.

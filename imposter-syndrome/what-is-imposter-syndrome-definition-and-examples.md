# What is imposter syndrome: definition and examples

## What is imposter syndrome?

Simply put, imposter syndrome is one or many negative thoughts we experience when we are struggling to attain a goal or have attained a goal. If you see imposter syndrome as a tree, the roots of this syndrome grow from the belief that "*I am not good enough.*" As this belief grows, it creates a series of negative thoughts that you play over and over in your mind. If the syndrome is not dealt with, it can deeply harm your progress, decrease your confidence, and even turn you away from your dreams.

## What does imposter syndrome look like?

Since imposter syndrome is a series of negative thoughts that go through our minds and there are over 7.8 billion humans on earth, this means that Imposter syndrome can take over 7.8 billion forms! You will experience imposter syndrome differently from your peer, your mentor, your employer, your friends, and more. Let's explore a few examples of what this syndrome can look like so you have a better idea when it starts happening to you.

### Example of imposter syndrome with failure

- *I should know how to write this code by now, but I don't! I've failed again! Despite all my efforts, I keep forgetting how to write this code and what to do first...What is wrong with me? I'm punishing myself trying and trying to code...Maybe I should just go back to what I was doing before, I had a simple life and never failed then. This coding is too much work and too much failure!*

### Example of imposter syndrome in Pair-programming

- *My peer is working through the project much faster than I and she understands the code very quickly. I have no clue where to begin...I'm so stupid...what am I even doing here? Do I actually belong here??... I'm such a failure, I will never catch up and finish the project on time...I'm going to fail...I know it!*

### Example of imposter syndrome in job searching

- *Wow, I've just seen a job I like in the company I've always wanted to work with, but they are asking for 5 years of experience...Should I even apply? I don't have 5 years so it would be a waste of time to apply...I better not apply...it would save me the embarrassment of a rejection...yes you're right, I won't apply, it's better that way...*

### Example of imposter syndrome in interviewing

- *I have a call with the recruiter in a few hours...she's going to find out that I don't know anything about Ruby and that all I've done is a small calculator app! She's going to find out I'm a fraud! What should I do?? This is going to be a horrible experience...maybe I should just cancel the meeting now...*

### Example of imposter syndrome when you finally get the job

- *Oh no, I can see on the zoom call that my manager doesn't look happy today...I think it's because I didn't finish my last task on time...I'm sure that's why...He hates me now...I wish I had finished it on time...Now I'm going to lose my job because I am not good enough...*

### Example of imposter syndrome with success

- *Oh wow, I just got the prize for employee of the month! I know I should be happy but...did I really deserve this prize?? I'm sure they just gave it to me because they wanted to be kind and nice...I didn't actually do anything great...Maybe it's a way of them giving me a prize before they throw me out of the company? Maybe there's a plan to get rid of me nicely and gently??*

### Example of imposter syndrome with ageism

- *I'm X years old and I'm still studying to be a junior developer! This is for young people...they must be laughing at me being here...And let's think about it: "Which employer is going to hire a junior developer as old as me??" No one, I'm sure of it! I better stop now...It's not worth it!*

### Example of imposter syndrome with racism

- *Black people have fewer chances of getting jobs...look at my white friends who have all gotten jobs...I'm sure I will never get one because of my skin color. Why am I wasting my time trying to learn to code when I know that I have no chance of getting a job?? Why am I doing this??*

### Example of imposter syndrome with sexism

- *I'm just a woman...all my peers are men and they are doing better than me. Maybe women are just slower? Maybe we don't belong in tech? But I still have a dream to be in tech though...could this just be a dream...yes maybe it's just a dream and I should stop wasting my time....yes women are just not as good as men in tech...It's better I go do something else...*

As you saw above, imposter syndrome can take many forms. This syndrome can also be intensified when you are working alone. In the next paragraph, we will explore this syndrome in a remote working environment.

### Remote working and imposter syndrome

If you have ever worked in an office environment before, you will notice that it is much easier to communicate with your colleagues face-to-face, to talk about issues you have with your manager, and to discuss freely with your collaborators. This is because of the physical and human connection you feel when you are in-person. In a remote-environment however, this connection is reduced because you are mainly working on your own, without anyone to share your feelings with or talk to. Remote environments increase the possibility of imposter syndrome which is why it is really important to identify it as soon as possible and deal with it. We will discuss later on in this lesson how to deal with your imposter syndrome.

Now that you understand what imposter syndrome is and have seen some examples, let's return to the main page and look at the impacts of this syndrome and how to deal with it.

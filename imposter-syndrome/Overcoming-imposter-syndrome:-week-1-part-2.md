## Learning objectives

- Continue expanding toolkit for recognizing and overcoming imposter syndrome.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

In this lesson, you will watch videos of Microverse staff and a software developer at Google and their experience with imposter syndrome.

### Why is this important?

Coding can be very difficult. Some people are completely new to it, others have been trying for a while but never with the full-time commitment, and some people come from a completely different career before joining software development. Struggling with code can feel exhausting. The following question might come into our minds: Should I quit? Will I ever be good enough to work full-time as a software developer?

In the following videos, you will see experienced people who explain their experience with software development, how it led them to have doubts while learning how to code and the doubts they had while searching for a job.

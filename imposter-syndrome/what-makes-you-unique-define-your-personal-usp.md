## Learning objectives

### Estimated time: 2h

## Description

In this exercise, you will learn what a Unique Selling Point (USP) is, why it is important, and how to create your own USP by doing exercises.

### Why is defining your personal USP important?

Have you ever been asked any of the following questions in an interview?

- *"Why should I hire you?"*
- "*What makes you different from other candidates?"*

The answer to each of these questions is called your *Unique Selling Point* or *Unique Selling Proposition (USP)*. Your USP is very important in every step of your job search. You will need to use it when writing your cover letter, elevator pitch, resume, and even when you begin networking with hiring managers. This is because your USP shows your unique personality and experiences, as well as the skills you have acquired over time. Having experience on your resume is not the only way to attract the attention of a recruiter; your USP can also help you do this effectively.

### What is a USP?

Your USP is a set of skills, knowledge, experiences, and personality traits that make you different or unique and which you can offer to provide value to a company.

### Creating your personal USP

The first step to creating your USP (i.e. to identify your own uniqueness) is to write down your life story. Your life story makes you very unique because no one has lived the same things as you. Later in this exercise, you will begin by creating your USP, then writing it out, and finally presenting it to your partner. To prepare for this, we want you to understand well how to create your personal USP:

### Presenting your personal USP

One of the best ways to learn to confidently answer questions about your USP in interviews is to practice out loud. This helps reduce pre-interview stress and allows your brain to become familiar with this new information. Thus, in the exercise below, you will be presenting the USP you just created to your partner and then switching roles.

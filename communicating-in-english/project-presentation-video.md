# Project presentation: record your video

## Learning objectives

- Communicate technical concepts to other technical people.
- Communicate technical concepts to non-technical people.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise

Part of being a remote web developer is not only writing code but is being able to talk about that code to others, both technical and non-technical co-workers. Whether you’re telling your manager what you’re working on, trying to explain how you did something to your Product Manager, or asking another developer for help, communicating about what you’re working on clearly and effectively is a key skill.

In the previous exercise, you prepared a draft for a presentation of your portfolio. Today, you’ll record a Loom video sharing these key points. 

**Instructions**

1. Open the outline you created in the previous activity.
2. Open [Loom.com](http://Loom.com).
3. Record a Loom walking through your outline. 
4. *Optional* Review your Loom and re-record if needed. Resist the urge to re-record more than once. Recording yourself on video can feel uncomfortable, but you’ll get more comfortable with practice!
5. Add your Loom walkthrough to your project README.
6. Submit your Loom via your Student Dashboard.

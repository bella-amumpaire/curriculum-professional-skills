### **Estimated time**: 0.25h

## Description

You will learn how to prepare for and attend your industry professional mock interview in this lesson.

### Why is attending your industry professional mock interview important?

Your industry professional mock interview is an opportunity to have an interview with a professional software developer. This will give you the feeling of what an actual interview is like and prepare you for the real interviews you will have in the future. Also, your interviewer will give you feedback at the end of the session.

### How should you prepare for your industry professional mock interview?

In a [previous exercise](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/JSR-schedule-your-industry-professional-mock-interview-v5.md), you should have scheduled your interview with an industry professional mock interviewer. As in any other interview, preparing and being on time is essential to perform well. Follow these steps:

1. **Find a quiet place where you won’t be interrupted.** Have a good internet connection and enough light to illuminate your face. Ensure that the setting looks professional, but if that’s impossible, use a virtual background. Place your camera at the level of your eyes so that you look straight up front, not down or up, and there is enough space above your head. To learn more about preparing the setting for a video interview, analyze [this infographic](https://pilbox.themuse.com/image.png?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.themuse.com%2Fuploaded%2Fattachments%2F40538%2F7779d505-d5d1-48f1-bb6d-1f3c80dee5bf.png%3Fv%3D2e4cd9fa510f4997e5ab8a4b04f67176960f9d69efddbec778f20d2a26c18cd9&prog=1&w=780) carefully.

2. **Test your audio and camera settings** with a friend or relative at least a day before to have time to solve any problem. Then, test again 10 minutes before the meeting to ensure they are working correctly.

3. **Set a reminder in your calendar** to alert you at least 15 minutes before the interview so you can be ready.

4. Make sure you are smartly dressed and that you **look professional**.

5. **Have a pen and paper** by your side to take notes during the interview. Open the template to gather feedback from the interviewer. Have your behavioral grid handy for ideas to answer behavioral questions.

6. Important: **turn off any AI-related helper tools** (like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)). You want to demonstrate your raw coding ability without any help.

**These same steps will help you be ready for actual job interviews.**

### How you will be evaluated

The goal of the mock interview is for you to practice participating in a similar interview as the ones you will face during your job search and to **help clarify how hirable you are**.

Your final evaluation will result in a score between 1 and 4, where 1 means you need to improve substantially to be prepared for job interviews ("Strong no hire") and 4, that you are very well prepared for interviews ("Strong hire"). You can learn more about the criteria used in the industry to assess technical interviews by looking at the guidelines from the [TechInterviewHandbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-rubrics/).

If you score 1 or 2, you will need to repeat the block, hone your interview skills, and attend another interview. So you should take extra care with implementing the feedback your interviewer will give you to improve for the next time.

❗️On the "Professional Skills Feedback" page on your Student Dashboard, you will be able to check your scores for the different types of questions and recommended resources you can study.

Good luck with your preparation!

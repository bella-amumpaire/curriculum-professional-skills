# Schedule two Pramp interviews for more practice

## Learning objectives

- Practice answering behavioral interview questions in a mock interview setting.
- Practice answering technical interview questions in a mock interview setting.

### **Estimated time**: 0.25h

## Description

In this activity, you will schedule one behavioral and one technical Pramp interview to practice your interview skills with different interviewers.

### Why are Pramp mock interviews important?

Participating in as many mock interviews as possible will help you ace actual interviews. So, itâ€™s time to do some more Pramp practice. Remember that repeated practice is can boost your confidence and reduce impostor syndrome during important interviews. It will also prepare you to score satisfactorily in your industry professional mock interview.

When scheduling the interviews, please consider that you will need to attend both interviews and submit the feedback in week 2 of this module.

### Scheduling reminder

- Green flags indicate a very strong match: someone who matches well with your background and skill set and will likely give you a great interview experience.
- Yellow flags indicate a nice match: someone who may not be quite as good of a fit, but who should still be able to give you a good interview experience.
- No flags indicate a mediocre interview fit, someone who may or may not give you a good interview experience.
- Remember to prioritize green flags first, yellow flags second, and no flags last.

**Make sure that you schedule the first interview before Saturday of week 2 in this module.**

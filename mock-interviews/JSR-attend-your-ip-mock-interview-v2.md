# Attend your industry professional mock interview

**❗️ Important note:**
If you are repeating this block because you didn't get the required score in your industry professional mock interview, you need to schedule another one. To do so, please contact ennio.poscia@microverse.org. We suggest that you study carefully the feedback we offer about your performance on your Dashboard and focus your efforts on honing your interview skills during the week.

## Learning objectives

- Show up prepared and on time for an interview with an industry professional.

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Description

You will attend your industry professional mock interview on the date and time that you scheduled. Once you participate in the interview, the industry professional mock interviewer will inform Microverse of your score.

Please remember:

- The interview is a module requirement, so you must complete it before the module ends.

- You will be scored in a scale of 1 to 4, where 4 means you are well prepared for interviews and 1 that you need to improve to get a job. **This activity will be marked as complete if you obtain a score of 3 or 4.** If you receive a 1 or 2, you will not complete this activity and you will have to repeat a block.

- On the "Professional Skills Feedback" page on your Student Dashboard, you will be able to check your scores for the different types of questions and recommended resources you can study.

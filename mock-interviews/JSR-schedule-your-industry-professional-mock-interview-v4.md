# Schedule your industry professional mock interview

## Learning objectives

- Show up prepared and on time for an interview with an industry professional.

### **Estimated time**: 0.25h

## Description

In this exercise, you will schedule a mock interview with a industry professional who will assess your performance.

**Attending this interview and receiving a satifactory score from the interviewer** is required to complete successfuly the third block of this module. 

The industry professional mock interviewer will assess and rate your performance using a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 means you need to improve substantially to be prepared for job interviews and 4, that you are very well prepared. To successfully complete the interview, you will need a score of 3 or 4. If you get a score of 1 or 2, you will repeat the block so that you can hone your interview skills and schedule another interview. 

### Why is scheduling your industry professional mock interview important?

Your industry professional mock interview is an opportunity to have an interview with a professional software developer. This will give you the feeling of what an actual interview is like and prepare you for the real interviews you will have in the future. Also, your interviewer will give you feedback at the end of the session.

Later in the module, we will help you prepare for the interview, plan how to gather feedback about your performance in a mock interview, self-assess yourself in the different aspects covered in the interview, and define SMART goals to improve your interview skills.

**Your behavioral grid will help you answer behavioral interview questions. Make sure you complete the "Create stories for your behavioral grid with CARL" assignment before this interview. It will help you succeed!**
  

### How do you schedule your industry professional mock interview?

1. **Figure out the possible dates for your interview.** Module 7 is three blocks long and you should attend the interview before the end of the module. So if you are scheduling it on Day 1 of the module you will have almost three weeks to attend â€” until the Friday of week 3. For example: if you start module 7 on Monday, November 7th, you will be finishing week 3 on Saturday, November 26th. Thus, you should schedule your interview between November 7th and 26th. 

2. **Schedule your meeting.** Through your Student Dashboard, you will access Calendly to select the date and time for your interview. Follow these steps:
    - Go to your "View Progress Page", and find this activity.
    - Click on the "Actions" button that appears at the right-hand side. 
    - Select the "Schedule interview" option. 
    - On the Calendly page that appears, select a day that suits your schedule, based on the step above. 
    - Choose the time.
    - Fill in your name and email address. Note: you must use the same email address you use for the Microverse Student Dashboard. 
    
      **Calendly will send you a confirmation with the the interviewer's name, the date and time, and the link for the interview.** 

      **NOTE** - If you are unable to complete any of the steps above, or you cannot find availability within the required timeframe, please reach out to Student Success right away, so we can help you figure this out and ensure you attend your industry professional mock interview.

3. **Inform us about the date of your meeting.** In the following activity, please register the date and time of your meeting, and your interviewer's name.

### Rescheduling and cancellation policy

Since this interview is a very important activity for your job search, we invite you to avoid rescheduling or canceling it. But we know life happens! So, in case of adverse life events (such as illness, power outage, or family emergency), you can reschedule or cancel your interview **at least 24 hours before the scheduled time**. For example, if the meeting is at 12pm EAT, you should cancel on the previous day before 12pm EAT.

To reschedule or cancel, click the corresponding link that appears in the confirmation email sent from Calendly. If you are rescheduling, simply select an alternative date and time. Remember that you must attend the interview by the time you finish module 7 to avoid a block repetition.

# Attend your industry professional mock interview

## Learning objectives

- Show up prepared and on time for an interview with an industry professional.

### **Estimated time**: 1h

## Description

You will attend your industry professional mock interview on the date and time that you scheduled. Once you participate in the interview, the industry professional mock interviewer will inform Microverse of your score.

Please remember:

- The interview is a core requirement, so you must complete it by the end of the block to avoid a repetition.

- You will be scored in a scale of 1 to 4, where 4 means you are well prepared for interviews and 1 that you need to improve to get a job. **This activity will be marked as complete if you obtain a score of 3 or 4.** If you receive a 1 or 2, you will not complete this activity and you will have to repeat the block.

- On the "Professional Skills Feedback" page on your Student Dashboard, you will be able to check your scores for the different types of questions. Analyze your performance and study the recommended resources for the knowledge and skills that you need to hone.

### How should I complete this activity?

❗️ You don’t need to mark this activity as complete or submit anything in your dashboard.

Your interviewer will share your scores with MV when you have attended the interview. The activity will appear as "complete" if you got a score of 3 or 4, and "incomplete" if you got a 1 or 2.

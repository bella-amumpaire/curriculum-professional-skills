# Review stories for the behavioral grid with CARL

## Description

Students will write two stories for their behavioral grid using the CARL framework (Context, Action, Result, Learning) and receive feedback from their career coach to make sure it meets all requirements before they start job searching. It takes place in the last module of the Core program. Please do an in-depth revision of the stories using the rubric, make specific comments and suggestions in the GDoc, and approve it ONLY if it meets all requirements. Request all changes necessary.

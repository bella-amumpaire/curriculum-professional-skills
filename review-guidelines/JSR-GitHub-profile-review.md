# Assess the GitHub Profile

## Description

Students will refine their GitHub profile and submit it for review to a career coach. Please do an in-depth revision of the profile to make sure it meets ALL the requirements before approving it.

## Get ready for the review

- ❗️The scoring rubric will be available through the Dashboard.
- This is the [activity with instructions](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/JSR-update-and-refine-your-GitHub-profile.md) that job searchers see.
- This is [the rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bKRDHlZMUc9xIQrktnoRMs8Z6e3k_fdeFipr1IT1cWw/edit#) they use to polish their profile.

## Mandatory Requirements

- Students should meet all the requirements in the rubric.
- You may accept a profile with only  a minimum of 4 pinned projects for those students that have limited coding experience. But do tell them that they must work to have at least 6 in order to get a job.

## Stretch Requirements

Any other requirements that you require to the students you should mark them with the [OPTIONAL] tag. Thanks to you, our students will learn more!!

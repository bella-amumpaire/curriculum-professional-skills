# Strenghten and update your resume

## Description

Job searchers will work on the resume they created in the core program using the rubric to make sure it tells their story and improve it to meet all the requirements. Your review is required to make sure they achieve these two purposes. They will have 3 rounds or review. Please request all changes necessary.

We ask students to share the resume in Gdocs with permission for anyone with the link to view and make comments. Please include comments in the Gdoc itself to help students identify aspects that need improvement.

## Get ready for the review

- ❗️ Study the [rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zbluw7oamzhFy40XR3nzbs6ZayK-iKEa2Y3AMJ1QDWY/edit#)
- Familiarize yourself with the [instructions they receive to work on their resume](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/JSR-strenghten-and-revamp-your-resume.md).

## Mandatory requirements

The resume should meet all the requirements in the rubric. After this module, the student will be sending job applications. If the resume isn't ready, it's not helpful for them to move on.

### Project requirements

The requirements are grouped in six sections:

- Template
- Summary
- Skills section
- Experience section
- Education section
- Formatting

## Stretch requirements

Any other requirements that you require to the students you should mark them with the [OPTIONAL] tag. Thanks to you, our students will learn more!!

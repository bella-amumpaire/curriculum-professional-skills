# Job search plan and SMART goals review guidelines

## Description

In week 1, job searchers will define their job searching plan and SMART goals for the first months:

- On Monday, they will work their goals for submitting applications and interview practice in this activity.
- On Tuesday, they review information about networking, and define their networking plan and goals.
- On Wednesday, they learn how to plan a side project, define their first project and the related SMART goals, and submit the plan and the goals for review.

## Get ready for the review

- This is the format that job searchers are using to define their goals.
- These are the [instructions they receive to plan their goals for submitting applications and interview practice](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/update-your-job-searching-plan-and-set-SMART-goals.md).
- These are the [instructions they recevie to plan their networking plan and goals](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/review-your-networking-plan-and-set-smart-goals.md).
- These are the [instructions they receive to plan their side project](https://github.com/matovu-farid/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/job-search/job-searching-how-to-plan-a-good-side-project.md).

## Mandatory requirements

NOTE: Each job searcher faces a specific situation. Use these requirements as guidelines, but consider the necessary adaptations to each particular case.

### General requirements

Students should include:

1. Statement of long- and mid-term professional goals, and

2. SMART goals that show how they will:

- Apply to jobs.
- Hone technical skills and add coding projects to portfolio.
- Practice interviewing.
- Continue networking.

### Project requirements

Long-term and mid-term goals in section 1 invite job searchers to start thinking about their professional career. Depending on the job searcher's ability to reflect and instrospect, the depth and level of detail may vary and that's okay. The only important aspect is that they start thinking about their professional future. Make any comment or include questions that can help them deepen their introspection.

Students should include at least one SMART goal for each of these areas: job applications, adding projects to their portfolio, practicing interviews, and networking.

Check that the SMART goals satisfy the five attributes:

- Specific: They clearly state the goal they want to accomplish.
- Measurable: There are clear metrics to asses progress of the goal.
- Achievable: The goal is something within their control and feasible within the allotted time.
- Relevant & Result-focused: It is a goal that will contribute to their getting a job.
- Time-dependent: They specify when they will achieve this goal.

Here's what a good SMART goal sounds like: "I will apply to 15 jobs next week."

It is:

- Specific: Applying to jobs. Something nonspecific might sound like, "I will look for jobs."
- Measurable: 15 is measurable. Something not measurable might sound like, "I will apply to jobs every day." How many?
- Achievable: 15 per week is a reasonable goal. It's possible to set an unachievable goal though. It's likely most people can't apply to hundreds of jobs per week.
- Relevant & Result-focused: This is a goal that is relevant to your long-term aspiration of getting a job. An irrelevant goal might sound like, "I will clean my workspace this weekend." That's nice and it might help you stay focused and organized, but it is too tangential and not directly relevant enough to your job search.
- Time-dependent: Sets a next week deadline. Something not time-dependent might sound like, "I will apply to 15 jobs." Okay, by when?

## Stretch requirements

If you want to go above and beyond with your SMART goals, don't just talk about goals like a certain number of jobs applied to per week or implementing a feature on one of your side projects. Those are good goals, but even better goals go into more detail or improve upon your previous goals in some way.

For example, you could set a goal of tailoring your application materials for a new class of tech job you hadn't tailored them for yet. You could also set more ambitious goals like looking for how to contribute to a popular open source project by reaching out to its community and offering to help fix a bug or implement a feature. The best SMART goals build upon previous ones so your achivements compound over time.

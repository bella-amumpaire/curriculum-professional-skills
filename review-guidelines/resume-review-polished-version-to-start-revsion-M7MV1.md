# Review polished version of resume to start rounds of revision with job searchers

## Description
Job searchers will dedicate one whole week to review their resume with feedback from their career coach. In this exercise, the students polish their latest version of the resume and submit it to start the process. In this review, you should do an in-depth revision of the resume and send comments so that they can work on them throughout the week. Please request all changes necessary.

# Review the cover letter created in step 3 of the submit a job application process

## Description

In this activity, students will create a cover letter for a specific job application, so its content to be tailored to those specific requirements. In the 2 previous steps, they found the job posting and analyzed if it was fit for them, and researched the company.

To let you assess the pertinence of their arguments, they will submit a worksheet where they include the URL to the job posting (section 1,) and the text of the cover letter (section 3.)

**You only need to review section 3, the text of their cover letter.**

They will have 3 rounds of review. Please request all changes necessary to ensure that students have learned:

- present clearly arguments regarding why they are a good fit for the job
- illustrate them with evidence from their past experiences, education, or projects.

We ask students to share their cover letter in Gdocs with permission for anyone with the link to view and comment. Please include comments in the Gdoc to help students identify aspects that need improvement.

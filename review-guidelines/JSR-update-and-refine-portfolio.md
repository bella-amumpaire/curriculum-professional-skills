# Review refined version of portfolio

## Description

Students will update and refine their portfolio with feedback from their career coach. It takes place in the last module of the Core program, before students start to job search. This review seeks to make sure that **their job application materials are ready to help them move through the recruitment process**.

In this review, you should do an in-depth revision of the portfolio using the required rubric and keep the following in mind:

- Approve only if it meets **ALL** requirements.
- Students will have a **max of 3 rounds of revisions**.
- In the **first** and **second** review, you can request changes.
